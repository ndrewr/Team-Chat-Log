July - Oct 2015

Ghavin 07/16/2015
Hello ,team look forward to working with y'all
Alicia 07/16/2015
Hey Ghavin! I look forward to working with you as well! :)
Ghavin 07/16/2015
Good to know! Feels good get a response! Thanks Alicia!
Steve 07/16/2015
Hi, looking forward to working with everyone as well!
Ghavin 07/16/2015
Hey Steve, I look forward to working with ya!
Steve 07/16/2015
You too Ghavin!
Andrew   07/17/2015
Noice. There's an app, well played, Udacity!
Andrew   07/17/2015
Hi everyone, this is Andrew, Im the Team Guide dude. We are scheduled for Sunday 630pm...but hey we got this comfy virtual room would be a shame to not use it more often.
Andrew   07/17/2015
If there are any questions, comments, musings or cat gifs please feel free to post anytime. I intend to check in here most days.
Andrew   07/17/2015
In a frightening development, I have everyone's names and backgrounds but in case you don't have mine, I'm a FE grad from last Oct. Currently in the Full-Stack, preparing job applications and doing a bit of freelance.
Andrew   07/17/2015
I'm in Southern California, Orange County so that is Pacific Time. However just came back from a trip to Japan and wooo I am jetlagged.
Andrew   07/17/2015
Anyways, virtual High Fives to all!
Andrew   07/17/2015
Oh, on that last point, I recently learned the history of the high five... http://priceonomics.com/the-inventor-of-the-high-five/
Ghavin 07/18/2015
Awesome thanks for the hi-five brain food! I look forward to working with you Andrew!
Ghavin 07/18/2015
I was told to save this link and share it with you guys http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VLBxYE
This is my project 0
Andrew   07/22/2015
Viewing on my phone screen, that's lookin sharp, Ghav!
One suggestion, just for kicks: on bigger screens consider larger fonts and even rearranging the content section into columns.
Also, I dig the quality profile pic and it reminds me that I need to upgrade my own. Anyone have tips there? I am leaning twd just paying for a few professional headshots but maybe my phone or mac could do the job.
Btw, is everyone on Project 0 or 1 now? Just to get a feel for topics to discuss.
Kshitiz 07/19/2015
Hey team, this is my project 0
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yNqZgq


### Session

Matthew 07/19/2015
Hey guys. so I have a question, are you guys getting different source code to download where the name and location is centered below the profile image as opposed to in line with the rest of the questions? Or are you editing it to look like that? Does it matter? How much customization should we be doing? Okay, enough questions. Here's mine: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/waxOwX
Andrew   07/19/2015
Hi everyone! Typing to you live from Starbucks
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: are you talking about the starter code for the project?
Andrew   07/19/2015
BTW, I seem to be having some syncing issues btwn the Team android app and the in-browser app... anyone else notice this?
Steve 07/19/2015
Good evening Team, here is my Code pen!
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bdjZGx
for project 0
i do not have the issue
i am seeing the chat updates on my phone while typing on my pc
Andrew   07/19/2015
Well at any rate, we are underway with Study Time. Steve I am jealous of your flawless user xp
Steve 07/19/2015
*knocks on wood
Andrew   07/19/2015
So its looking like most of the team is on Project 0...when did your cohort begin?
Steve 07/19/2015
I joined mid last week, if that is what you are asking.
Andrew   07/19/2015
and as folks trickle in, please give a quick shoutout so we all know you are here
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve: cool
Andrew   07/19/2015
So the format of our study session is limited to chat for now but I encourage folks to post in here whenever with the goal being we check in regularly
Andrew   07/19/2015
this being the first session I figured light intros as folks check in would be cool
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve, I saw from your profile you are in Data Analysis?
Steve 07/19/2015
correct
Matthew 07/19/2015
yeah I was talking about the starter code for Project 0
Andrew   07/19/2015
Hi Matt!
Matthew 07/19/2015
its not a huge deal I've just seen some slightly different ones
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve: this is a JS library that you might be diving into in the near future:
http://d3js.org/
Andrew   07/19/2015
A library for visual display of data
Steve 07/19/2015
interesting Andrew, i'll check it out. Thanks!
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt, what are some o the differences you have seen?
Matthew 07/19/2015
just that under some people's picture is their name and location centered and with the code I downloaded its more to the left and question format with the rest of the questions
Andrew   07/19/2015
Let me jump into your Codepen and compare with Steve's...
Matthew 07/19/2015
Im just confused on what udacity really wants I guess. I need like a FAQ of deadlines and what needs done exactly and when, lol.
but i'll be okay.
Steve 07/19/2015
as a reference, I did not do any customization to my project. Just what was asked by the requirement.
Alicia 07/19/2015
the due dates timeline is on your homepage @Matthew
Andrew   07/19/2015
Hi Alicia!
Alicia 07/19/2015
hey Andrew
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: I see what you mean, comparing to Ghavin's the structure is slightly different
Andrew   07/19/2015
I DON"T think its an issue that will be marked down however...
Andrew   07/19/2015
Does Project 0 have a grading rubric?
Alicia 07/19/2015
i dont think so, they just left comments on mines.
Matthew 07/19/2015
Okay cool, thats what I was wondering!
Andrew   07/19/2015
OK interesting...back when I did the program there was no Project 0, lol
Matthew 07/19/2015
so I do see the due dates, I was just wondering if I was behind because I signed up a little late. Have you done Project 1 already too, Alicia?
Andrew   07/19/2015
The projects I did all had grading rubrics tho that outlined the stuff that was REQUIRED and the stuff that was gravvy
Matthew 07/19/2015
aah
Alicia 07/19/2015
I'm working on project 1 now @Matthew. I have been coding on and off for some years and never seriously sat down to learn it all the way through..
Alicia 07/19/2015
I did project 1 but I'm actually sitting through the lessons to make sure i did evevrything right/required for the project.
Andrew   07/19/2015
It seems everyone who has checked in did Project 0 just recently (and I definitely encourage yall to post links to your projects, I'lll definitely check em out and hopefully other teammates will as well)
Matthew 07/19/2015
Nice. I think I can handle it, I just need to get familiar with the new frameworks and such. I just did a wedding site for my wife and I at http://mattloveskat.com
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: good stuff! Do you already have a background in web languages?
hah, 'honeyfund'
Alicia 07/19/2015
this looks good, congratulations!
Matthew 07/19/2015
I've taken html css and js classes before but its been awhile and I need a certification or something because I never got a degree
Matthew 07/19/2015
trying to get something good to put on a resume at least. but thank you!
Steve 07/19/2015
Grats matt!
did you use a framework for this or coded all the CSS stuff scratch?
Steve 07/19/2015
i like how it's responsive :)
Matthew 07/19/2015
all from scratch, I am excited to get into frameworks, but I dont even know if I understand how they work. like bootstrap is one we will get into, right?
Steve 07/19/2015
nice! Ya I saw we will get into a bit of bootstrap too.
Alicia 07/19/2015
yes bootstraps in there
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: you'll have some solid projects by the end of this...thats definitely a Plus for hitting the Udacious points in the project rubrics...better exercise of your skills = better display for a portfolio
Andrew   07/19/2015
Alicia, how are you finding Bootstrap?
Andrew   07/19/2015
what I mean is, has it been pretty straightforward to break out in your project or has there been some pain points?
Andrew   07/19/2015
(looks like Project 1...responsive portfolio page, if memory serves)
Alicia 07/19/2015
yea i thought i saw it in the project 1 lessons
Steve 07/19/2015
Andrew, what do you mean the Udacious points in the project rubrics?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Hmm, its lookin like Project 0 doesn't have the grade rubric...Note to Self hahah
Matthew 07/19/2015
So are you working on a new program now Andrew?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve: most likely from P1 (and a teammate can confirm) your 'Evaluation and Submission' section in the project description will have a scale/rubric outlining the stuff REQUIRED to pass...
Andrew   07/19/2015
and the stuff that is suggested for Awesomeness and Fun but not required
Steve 07/19/2015
got it
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: Yup! I took the FE program back in Oct...it was their maiden run so a bunch of stuff was still WIP. No project 0, for instance!
Andrew   07/19/2015
Right now, I am on the Full Stack program (taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement) :p
Andrew   07/19/2015
BTW, does everyone know all the sources of Help that are available to ya?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Just to list (and please add if I forget any):
Andrew   07/19/2015
- The Office Hours I think are 3 times a week
Matthew 07/19/2015
nice I would like to do that one too
Andrew   07/19/2015
- There are 1 to 1 sessions that require calendar appt
Andrew   07/19/2015
- Cohort forums (really hope yall have an active one...really effects the community value you get from the program)
Andrew   07/19/2015
OK, what other help options are there...
Andrew   07/19/2015
AH, GOOGLE of course, lol ... everyone, if you havent already, definitely BOOKMARK Stackoverflow and CSS-Tricks.
Andrew   07/19/2015
Those are two of my most trusted online resources
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: an interesting note on the FS program....I realize now I am definitely more of a Front-End guy! I've been OK with the database and user authorization stuff but would rather have a coworker take care of it :p
Steve 07/19/2015
is Cohort forums the Udacity forum?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Yeah it is...I keep saying 'Cohort' in reference to every new monthly class just cuz thats how Udacity was referring to it
Andrew   07/19/2015
So to be clear, by 'Cohort Forum', I am talking about the private forum reserved for program students and not the public ones
Steve 07/19/2015
aah got it, tahnk you
Steve 07/19/2015
oh wait private?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Sure, to be honest, there are a bunch of stuff available in the program that too me a while to figure out I had access to. If yall are uncertain where to find an answer or where to get a question answered, I'm sure collectively we can point to the right place
Steve 07/19/2015
is it the one under the resource tab?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve: lets see...I'll hit up my main Udacity page now (they have been changing the layout ALOT over the months)
Steve 07/19/2015
in my front end degree page, "Resources " -> "useful links"-> "discussion forum"?
Andrew   07/19/2015
ok, YES that is it. Those forums, broken down into project categories
Steve 07/19/2015
awesome, got it :)
Andrew   07/19/2015
most of those are private to your own class, though the General boards are open to all cohorts
Andrew   07/19/2015
You know what, I didn't even notice that the layout changed like that til you asked...I'm discovering this 'Resource tab' for the first time lol
Andrew   07/19/2015
I've had my forum page open in a tab for like 3 months straight so never had to go through the profile page :p
Steve 07/19/2015
Andrew since you finished the FE program,
Steve 07/19/2015
just in general i guess, is there anything you can advise us, things that you'd say to yourself "i wish i did/knew this 3 months ago at the start of the program"?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Thats a really good question. Answer: YUP...engage with all those resources as much as you can. I'll elaborate:
Andrew   07/19/2015
Forum participation: get to know classmates for support, networking and getting used to asking for help and offering it. I chat and swap resources with a bunch of my program grads to this day on a near-daily basis
Andrew   07/19/2015
Taking advantage of Udacity coach access: those are really cool, patient and friendly folks over there. I did not use the coaching appts nearly as much as I should I have. Its a chance if nothing else to chat with an experienced professional who would LOVE to answer your questions
Andrew   07/19/2015
Attending more of the Live Events...they have some outstanding ones that I failed to schedule due to laziness sometimes, To be honest. For example, a few months back they had a casual chat with Sebastain Thrun one of the Udacity co-founders. Thats incredible direct access to a very knowledgable and influential individual
Andrew   07/19/2015
...and hopefully, this Team setup will prove to be a valuable thing, too. That'll be up to us tho!
Steve 07/19/2015
Cool Andrew, thanks for the great advice, will definitely check out some of these resources!
Andrew   07/19/2015
Looking over all the profiles for our team members its actually really exciting considering the breadth of experiences and unique insights we encompass. I feel like I could have some excellent conversations with yall...hopefully Udacity fleshes out the messaging and chat functions of this app -_-
Andrew   07/19/2015
Cheers for the question...and that reminds me, if there are any questions or suggestions or critiques over any part of the program DEFINITELY voice it...whether here (cuz I am obligated to report back to the Udacity program coordinators lol) or directly to Udacity support. It helps em improve and no one will take it personally
Andrew   07/19/2015
So we haven't really discussed much technically this session. Are there any questions on CSS/HTML that are lingering? Or heck, some cool css skills recently discovered?
Andrew   07/19/2015
For example, Matt was talking about how he is excited to dive into Bootstrap even though he is not totally sure what it encompasses...
Steve 07/19/2015
I'm wondering more in general. Matt, I imagine writing all that CSS line by line might have taken a while. I only briefly looked at bootstrap, but was thinking when would a developer use a framework vs self code from scratch.
Matthew 07/19/2015
Hey is <header> <section> <main> <footer> etc that are in the html from project 0 new from html 5
Andrew   07/19/2015
Guys, diving headfirst into this new tech will be like a never-ending quest on the Front-End. New libraries and development paradigms pop in every year. For those that love to constantly learn and grow and challenge themselves its really a great field! Have no fear and go forward! :p
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt: yeah, those are semantic tags...
Matthew 07/19/2015
yeah it took longer and a lotta save and refresh lol.
Andrew   07/19/2015
Can anyone explain the purpose of those?
Andrew   07/19/2015
Functionally, they are pretty much DIVs...
Matthew 07/19/2015
thats what I figured
Andrew   07/19/2015
Actually, I never even noticed that MAIN tag is a thing until I was looking at yall's codepens :p
Andrew   07/19/2015
These semantic tags, far as I can tell (someone correct me if Im wrong) are for human readability. Technically I THINK they are just divs however, ie block-level grouping structures
Andrew   07/19/2015
Steve, great question...when would us devs lean on the framework vs writing on our own code/css?
Steve 07/19/2015
correct
i'd think the most likely scenario
Steve 07/19/2015
is to use a framework as a base, then edit the css to your own desires
Steve 07/19/2015
but not sure if there's any situation where frameworks can't be leveraged at all
Steve 07/19/2015
can't/shouldn't
Andrew   07/19/2015
So I agree: as a starting point or even a mock-up stage tool frameworks have tremendous use
Andrew   07/19/2015
As for if there are any technical situations where no framework can be utilized,
Andrew   07/19/2015
I don't think so...see, frameworks are meant to offer some base scaffolding/structure and give us devs a bunch of convenience tools and coding rules to speed up our work
Matthew 07/19/2015
see and I would like to implement frameworks to make things look more standardized and up to speed with the latest and greatest trends
Andrew   07/19/2015
It is possible however that your project restriction may demand a VERY small data footprint, perhaps to minimize download time...in that case going with the overhead of a framework may be a nogo
Andrew   07/19/2015
Matt, personally I feel like the vast majority of our smaller projects these days, with the internet speeds we have, using frameworks and libraries like a jQuery are no problemo
Andrew   07/19/2015
There is some places where framework use can lead to some headaches in development tho... I wonder what Alicia's experience has been working with it?
Andrew   07/19/2015
For me, there were times when CSS rules established by Bootstrap were NOT my desired end result...I had to resort to using "!important" to get my way in that tug-of-war hahah
Andrew   07/19/2015
Not a cure-all tho! When working in a team too much "!important" can be a disaster...
https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/
Andrew   07/19/2015
OK, guys, Starbucks is closing and I have been kicked out...this will be the official 'end' of our session
Matthew 07/19/2015
nice good info
thanks andrew, see ya next time
Steve 07/19/2015
yes, Thank you Andrew, it has been very helpful
Andrew   07/19/2015
But lets keep chatting and posting during the week casually...for instance I intend to lend a few comments on each of the codepens shared above
Andrew   07/19/2015
Thanks for participating guys...hope you are having as much fun with this stuff as I did when I started out!

### Session

Udacibot   07/22/2015
#WELCOME @Joshua to the team 😂!
Here's Joshua's bio:
"Cyber Security Engineer"
Andrew   07/22/2015
Hahah, alrighty...reloaded the Udacity android app just now and it finally posts the above!
Andrew   07/22/2015
Anyways, first off...welcome to Josh! Glad to have ya on our team and just want ya to know feel free to post in here anytime if there are questions or to share something cool. Our scheduled study time is 730 pm PST on sunday but I'll check in most days
Andrew   07/22/2015
Secondly, the blurb above was my comments on Ghav's project 0 link...one week delayed :p
Andrew   07/22/2015
I''m looking at the links shared by several teammates here and now I see what Matt brought up on Sunday...looks like there were two SLIGHTLY different code sources? The HTML structure is slightly different in the "hero" section. I'm more partial to the layout shown in Ghav and Kshitiz's (simply because its centered) but its nothing a little CSS can't fix!
Andrew   07/22/2015
I wanted to bring up one potential concern with the CSS I see in the pens y'all have shared:
Andrew   07/22/2015
Media Queries.... can anyone guess my qualm with the css? I'll bring this up again on Sunday cuz it might be a potential 'gotcha'
Andrew   07/22/2015
Let me repaste Steve's link just as a reference. I see the same code order in all the pens tho so I am guessing it is due to the starter code... http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bdjZGx
Udacibot   07/23/2015
#SAD that @KYOO HO has left the team. We will meet again 😭!
Udacibot   07/24/2015
#WELCOME @Clifton to the team 😂!
Here's Clifton's bio:
"I'm a designer, can't wait to advance my Front-end skills"
Andrew   07/24/2015
Welcome to our team, Clifton! Any questions, musings or links-o-the-day, please don't hesitate to post :)
Udacibot   07/24/2015
#EXCITED that @Guillermo submitted a project for P0: About Me! Congratulations 🙌!
Udacibot   07/25/2015

Udacibot   07/26/2015
#EXCITED that @Yui submitted a project for P0: About Me! Congratulations 🙌!
Udacibot   07/26/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait 🐬 🐳 🐙 !
Andrew   07/26/2015
Good evening all! Hope yall had a great week :D
Andrew   07/26/2015
Curious to see what everyone is working on...
Yui 07/26/2015
Lesson 1 about half way through.
Andrew   07/26/2015
I think JavaScript is on the table now woohoo!
Yui 07/26/2015
Hello, Andrew, nice to meet you.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Hi Yui! Good to see ya :)
Andrew   07/26/2015
How has the learning gone for you this week?
Yui 07/26/2015
So far so good, but I'm behind, so I need to catch up.
Yui 07/26/2015
(wasn't here last week.)
Andrew   07/26/2015
No worries, I saw you submitted P0. Congrats on that!
Andrew   07/26/2015
Was there any niggling issues with CSS or HTML that you experienced while doing it?
Yui 07/26/2015
Not so far. One quick question about the feedback though, if you don't mind.
Yui 07/26/2015
One comment was "Image linked locally. Good job!"
Yui 07/26/2015
Is this a common practice or preferred method?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yea, fire away...and if anyone else is around, please give us a hearty 'whats up'!
Matthew 07/26/2015
o hai
Matthew 07/26/2015
lol, did you all do all the work in the videos before doing project 1/
Andrew   07/26/2015
Hai~ Matt!
Matthew 07/26/2015
?*
Matthew 07/26/2015
Ive been busy, so I'm just starting project 1 now, will let you know how it goes!
Andrew   07/26/2015
Hm...I PROBABLY did...just because I generally have enjoyed the in lesson stuff
Andrew   07/26/2015
the thing is, like you, I came in with some CSS/HTML/JS under my belt.
Andrew   07/26/2015
I might have 'accelerated' the first project or two :p
Andrew   07/26/2015
Matt, besides the goings of LYFE, have there been any roadblocks with any of the materials this week?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui: thats a deep question...
Matthew 07/26/2015
not really, I'm new at implementing bootstrap so I'm scrolling the documentation page of it checking things out
Andrew   07/26/2015
my first blush is that, yup you guessed it, there are 'pluses and minuses'
Andrew   07/26/2015
Matt, do you have any opinions/prefs between locally linked images vs External?
Matthew 07/26/2015
I just like to have the locally incase someone externally messes with or deletes the image
Andrew   07/26/2015
mmm I see what ya mean. Thats a benefit of 'local images'... you don't worry that for example that the picture link you used is offline
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui, lemme ask you though...what do you consider a potential downside to using local/'internal' images?
Andrew   07/26/2015
And to be clear..
Andrew   07/26/2015
when I say 'local images' I mean that we are having our site server send over the image file itself
Andrew   07/26/2015
and if anyone has an opinion, please sound off
Andrew   07/26/2015
btw Matt, Bootstrap is beastly...I've used it for most of my projects so far. Looking forward to hearing your opinion of using it
Matthew 07/26/2015
It wouldn't make load time different would it? I'd say the only downfall would be the space it takes to store images if you have a lot
Andrew   07/26/2015
Load time is the key question
Andrew   07/26/2015
so when Yui asks whether its a preferred method, its absolutely common to 'package' those pics with your site (in other words serve up the image file yourself)
Andrew   07/26/2015
That said, its not neccesarily preferred! With load time being the key question, many devs find that using a third party with BLAZING FAST servers can actually improve load time
Andrew   07/26/2015
Have yall heard of the term 'CDN'? Anyone know what it means?
Yui 07/26/2015
I didn't really think about potential downside of using local images. I was more curious what professionals typically do.
Matthew 07/26/2015
No clue about cdn
Joshua 07/26/2015
Content delivery network
Yui 07/26/2015
Since I am new, I don't have any 'habit' or preference in my coding, so I would like to maybe set a standard, following what's most common. That is why I asked the question :)
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui, you really touched on a great question...so its totally fine to link locally your images. But many devs will either A) use a highly regarded CDN service for those files...
Josh, bingo, thanks man!
Yui 07/26/2015
Okay, thank you, I'll keep that in mind.
Andrew   07/26/2015
B) they may actually MIX the approaches...CDN first, but if the worst happens and its unavailable, send the files with your your own server
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui: its absolutely cool to link locally...to be fair, the issues I noted above are probably for sites with LOTS of users
Yui 07/26/2015
So, use of CDN would likely apply to big companies, rather than small individuals who are loading their webpage over their own home servers?
Yui 07/26/2015
Ah, already you answered XD.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui, very fair to say! Sry if I went overboard...I'm been thinking about that topic recently :)
Yui 07/26/2015
Thank you very much. A bit more to read about :)
Yui 07/26/2015
XD Why are you sorry. You are kindly answering :)
TY rather.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Matt: a really good example of CDNs in action...how are you linking your bootstrap files in your code?
Andrew   07/26/2015
oh BTW, everyone lets welcome Josh. He joined the team this week :D
Matthew 07/26/2015
well right now I just have "<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.css">"
Andrew   07/26/2015
Josh, how has the learning been goin this week? We are sniffing out any potential pain pts with Project 0 and 1...
Matthew 07/26/2015
but I dont know if i should be linking to the bootstrap.min one
or not
Andrew   07/26/2015
Matt: ah so you are linking locally. This is actually the same topic of load performance Yui touched on
Matthew 07/26/2015
True
Andrew   07/26/2015
boom here is the Get Bootstrap page:
http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
Joshua 07/26/2015
Well I'm off to a slow start, bc of with work, I haven't hit any pain points yet
Andrew   07/26/2015
do you guys see where they have one method of 'getting' the files under 'CDN'?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Question: who is serving up those bootstrap files?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Josh: first step is half the battle, cheers for getting underway!
Joshua 07/26/2015
Maxcdn?
Joshua 07/26/2015
I thought Google had a link to or is that just ajax
Andrew   07/26/2015
yup exactly....a company whose whole Reason for Being is serving up web content as fast as possible.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Josh: I think they do actually. Google also acts as cdn for a lot of these common libraries like JQUery
Andrew   07/26/2015
Matt, my thinking on linking library/framework files is ongoing...for development ABSOLUTELY. You can't beat the speed of getting the file from your own machine XD
Matthew 07/26/2015
That's what I was thinking but I didn't know about cdn's. Good to know!
Andrew   07/26/2015
heh, I'm actually googling now to see if I can find a list of what Google serves up as CDN...if anyone finds it please post
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yea, your intuition is a beast...tell ya what, I myself have not looked at using CDNs yet...my projects are too small-scale
Andrew   07/26/2015
btw, we chatted about this last week, but since this is Yui and Josh's first session...
Andrew   07/26/2015
can you guys name Five Ways to get help in the program? I know Matt already knows..
Yui 07/26/2015
by program, you mean Udacity program?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yes :p
Joshua 07/26/2015
Um.. 1 to 1 mentoring, the forums?
Yui 07/26/2015
1. Andrew RC 2. Email
Andrew   07/26/2015
One and Two
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yup, and this Team actually :) Thats Three
Andrew   07/26/2015
heh, I was chatting with other guides and we were listing these out...
Andrew   07/26/2015
Has anyone been able to catch any Office Hour casts?
Yui 07/26/2015
not me.
Matthew 07/26/2015
Nope
Andrew   07/26/2015
Not always the most convenient times huh :/
Andrew   07/26/2015
that is number Four, if you can catch em...the ones I've attended have never been more than a handful of classmates. A good source to get answers from Coaches more quickly than 1:1 appt
Andrew   07/26/2015
Do you guys have the link for the OH schedules? I wonder if its a set-in-stone or changes-weekly thing
Andrew   07/26/2015
hm, I can't access that sched from my own homepage...that makes sense since I'm not in the Front End program. If anyone can't find it tho, please let me know
Andrew   07/26/2015
So the Fifth resource is actually the most common. Its like, omnipotent ..
Andrew   07/26/2015
Likes to change its face on holidays...
Andrew   07/26/2015
Obsessed with self-driving cars.....!?
Matthew 07/26/2015
Lol
Matthew 07/26/2015
Of course
Andrew   07/26/2015
can you think of clever hint Matt?
Matthew 07/26/2015
Google
Matthew 07/26/2015
Lol too late. I'm using this team app on iOS and was lagging
Andrew   07/26/2015
oh, theres the answer lol...I was gonna say "acts like Dirty Harry...always asks if you "Feel Lucky"
Andrew   07/26/2015
So good stuff guys, quick recap with this one (cuz when I took the program I didn't know the list):
1:1 Appointments
Office Hours
Andrew   07/26/2015
CLass Forums (the private ones)
Andrew   07/26/2015
Google/Search/Bing I guess
Andrew   07/26/2015
This Team
Yui 07/26/2015
One can set up 1:1 appointment through email?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Has anyone had any 1:1? I've seen Forms for it for sure.
Yui 07/26/2015
Also, I am currently working on "Box revised" lecture (18th). I noticed that one of the class name changes from the previous lecture, I think. In the earlier lectures, one of the div class name was "screenshot" and in the Box Revised, the div class is called "image".
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui, you can definitely do it by email, although Udacity might point you to the Calendar Appt link
Yui 07/26/2015
Just an FYI. I might be wrong though!
Yui 07/26/2015
Ah, okay, I'll check that out. Thanks!
Andrew   07/26/2015
To be clear on the Appts, I found the link on the "Me" Udacity homepage under the resources tab
Andrew   07/26/2015
Ooo, that leads into a great topic, Yui...cheers!
Andrew   07/26/2015
Can someone explain the "Box Model" of CSS?
Yui 07/26/2015
Ah, found the links. TY!
Yui 07/26/2015
Welp, everything in HTML are boxes. box inside of box inside of box...
Andrew   07/26/2015
(btw Yui, if you see any mistakes in the videos don't hesitate to give Udacity a friendly earful...they looooove feedback)
Yui 07/26/2015
Okay, I wasn't sure what the right channel was. I'll do that.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Boxes in Boxes in Boxes :)
Andrew   07/26/2015
Can anyone name one or two of the values possible with the 'box-sizing' CSS property?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Or, an even better question...
Andrew   07/26/2015
what is the difference between the 'Content-box' value vs 'Border-box'??
Andrew   07/26/2015
...cuz wooo this issue is a 'gotcha' for everyone at some point heheh
Yui 07/26/2015
Those are not attributes, but elements?
Matthew 07/26/2015
no clue
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yes, I guess you could say elements that are set with one of those values
Yui 07/26/2015
Or maybe, Border-box includes Content-box
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui....Yes, that is true. Border-box does 'contain' the content-box
Andrew   07/26/2015
here is a scenario .... I set my square div with height and width 100px...
Andrew   07/26/2015
lets give the stuff inside that Div some breathing room...I set padding to 5px all around..
Andrew   07/26/2015
Question: how much space in total is the Div taking on my page?
Matthew 07/26/2015
400 pixels
I dunno
Yui 07/26/2015
what's the default margin?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui: thats a super fair question...lets say 0
Yui 07/26/2015
5 + 5 + 100 + margin(s) for width ?
border = 0.
Andrew   07/26/2015
if there any further clarfications needed, just lemme know....
Alicia 07/26/2015
110px x 110px ?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Hi Alicia!!
Alicia 07/26/2015
hey. been watching the whole time..just got off my bartending shift..sorry.
Andrew   07/26/2015
So, to answer...its a bit of a trick question
mwahah
Andrew   07/26/2015
ALicia you are correct...with the default 'box-sizing' value. But is it possible for that answer to be different?
Alicia 07/26/2015
no because one contains the margin and the other doesn't?
Andrew   07/26/2015
thats a good guess... it is possible tho for a Div 100 width and padding 5px all around to take up 100px total on your page
Andrew   07/26/2015
and THAT is what 'box-sizing: border-box' will do for you
Alicia 07/26/2015
right and content-box property doesn't include the padding border or margin either?
Andrew   07/26/2015
Just like Alicia and Yui suggested, with the default value of 'content-box' the browser will make sure your div is the width you set.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Alicia, exactly. Can someone explain a potential negative of 'content-box'? (To be clear its not Evil...just might be misleading in some way..)
Alicia 07/26/2015
i don't know..
Andrew   07/26/2015
totally cool. It dawned on me only after several projects of frowning while I positioned page elements
Andrew   07/26/2015
Its Layout where the difference lies.
Andrew   07/26/2015
With the default 'content-box' we will have to be aware of ALL the extra variables (padding, borders, margin) when we are laying out our elements on the page.
Andrew   07/26/2015
a small miscalculation could potentially become a gaping mistake in the layout @_@
Yui 07/26/2015
So, is using the option "box-sizing:border-box" very common?
Andrew   07/26/2015
so a lot of folks have taken to "resetting' their CSS to treat all elements with 'box-sizing: border-box' because then when you say 'DIV width 100px' on the page it will take 100px regardless of padding and border
Andrew   07/26/2015
I have had so many breaking layouts because ex. the border width broke something hahah
Yui 07/26/2015
It makes sense and using border-box seems like a good choice.
Andrew   07/26/2015
Yui: it is...in fact, I'm tempted to ask ya guys to peek inside Bootstrap if ya get the chance cuz I suspect they reset everything to 'border-box'
Andrew   07/26/2015
Alicia mentioned a key thing tho: that DOESN'T include the margins...the margins will be counted separately regardless of 'box-sizing' value
Andrew   07/26/2015
btw Alicia, how is the nanodegree study going? I think you are knee-deep in P1?
Yui 07/26/2015
Bootstrap... I just looked it up, so I know what it is now. But, are we talking about a specific Bootstrap, here?
Andrew   07/26/2015
to be clear, I do mean the Bootstrap library: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
Andrew   07/26/2015
It will be a good helper! Matt is getting his hands in it now and it is thick lol. But it has a ton of helpful parts
Alicia 07/26/2015
its cool .yea I'm on project 1, i just aint had time to get to everything else yet
Andrew   07/26/2015
Come to think it, even parts of Udacity use Bootstrap
Andrew   07/26/2015
Right on. If you hit any roadblocks with some CSS or JS stuff don't hesitate to bring it up! We could all learn from it :)
Alicia 07/26/2015
ok
Andrew   07/26/2015
Mates, I am going to call it a nite here...I've literally got some light bulbs to go change :p
Andrew   07/26/2015
I just got a couple links:
Matthew 07/26/2015
Okay see ya next time!
Andrew   07/26/2015
First I found this one on the box model: http://learnlayout.com/box-model.html
Andrew   07/26/2015
And a fellow guide just shared this awesome thing:
http://flukeout.github.io/
Yui 07/26/2015
Thanks, Andrew. Night!
Andrew   07/26/2015
its a CSS trainer. Man thats cool
Andrew   07/26/2015
Cheers all, please don't hesitate to question, post and chat in here during the week. I will definitely check in regularly and I hope everyone else will too!


### Session

Andrew   07/27/2015
whoops. Reviewing my notes for topics I wanted to cover last session I totally forgot to ask about CSS Media Queries... this might be more of a topic after the Responsive Web Design course tho.
Andrew   07/27/2015
So in Project 0 starter code, in the CSS file, I noticed one potential 'gotcha' with the order of the Media Query rules. The challenge, if you choose to accept it: What is the potential problem?
Andrew   07/27/2015
Again, here is teammate Steve's codepen link for reference but I saw the issue in everyone's project code: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bdjZGx
Andrew   07/27/2015
Hope this has been an epically good Monday for everyone!
Udacibot   07/28/2015
#EXCITED that @Matthew submitted a project for P1: Build a Portfolio Site! Congratulations 🙌!
Andrew   07/29/2015
Good stuff Matt! let us know if you want some eyeballs on the project
Udacibot   08/01/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 24 hours ⏰. Can't wait 🐬 🐳 🐙 !
Udacibot   08/02/2015
#SAD that @Guillermo has left the team. We will meet again 😭!
Andrew   08/02/2015
Hi fellow devs! Lookin forward to studying tonite :)
Andrew   08/02/2015
I MIGHT be 20-30 min late...will be comin from the airport, sorry for any delay.
Udacibot   08/02/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait 🐬 🐳 🐙 !
Matthew 08/02/2015
pretty frustrated with this crap"shorthand should be used whenever possible, even in cases where only one value is explicitly set."
Matthew 08/02/2015
so setting just one margin when the others are already set with bootstrap or whatever framework isn't good enough, you have to know what that framework has the other margins set at, change them all, play around until you figure it out, or do like '2px inherit inherit inherit' which is just stupid
Matthew 08/02/2015
or trying to change the border-width of an <hr> you have to write it out has border: 2px solid #000 whatever. but doing that changes the look of it as opposed to just having border-width and border-color
sonsa bitches
Matthew 08/02/2015
I could see when more than one value is explicitly set, but if you are just setting one, having to do all of them in a short hand version is painful
Joshua 08/02/2015
No joke
Andrew   08/02/2015
WOOT
Andrew   08/02/2015
I finally made it...my bad for the lateness yall!
Joshua 08/02/2015
Welcome to the party!
Andrew   08/02/2015
At a starbux now...caffeine in hand, lets talk Code :D
Andrew   08/02/2015
Cheers Josh, whats up Matt!
Andrew   08/02/2015
wait...I sense great css-pain in this chat room...
Joshua 08/02/2015
The force is strong with this one
Matthew 08/02/2015
much
lol
Andrew   08/02/2015
bootstrap helps so much...but NOTHING IS FREE mwahahah
Joshua 08/02/2015
Haha
Andrew   08/02/2015
how ya guys been this week?
Joshua 08/02/2015
Busy, I'm behind, working on a inventory app at work, powershell hell..
Andrew   08/02/2015
whatcha developing in? Is that C++?
Matthew 08/02/2015
good, im at my mother-in-laws house till we move this week and the internet is painfully slow. I wanna work with srcset and responsive images but this slow is killing me
http://mattloveskat.com/portfolio/
Matthew 08/02/2015
moved completely outta my old house yesterday and the day before - im never moving again
but somehow do it once a year
Andrew   08/02/2015
hah only thing worse than slow internets.
Andrew   08/02/2015
is NO internets...I felt the pain when I was traveling recently -_-
Joshua 08/02/2015
Built on top of .net I guess powershell is an abstraction layer, its syntax reminds me of JavaScript
Joshua 08/02/2015
But the cmdlets ass the call them, way to much use of |
As*
Andrew   08/02/2015
Josh, I hear SO MUCH about .Net being a mucho in-demand skillset. For someone comfy with JS you are saying its pretty smooth to get into .NET dev?
Joshua 08/02/2015
On a cell phone ary
Matthew 08/02/2015
ive been hearing about .net a lot too
how hard was it for you josh
Joshua 08/02/2015
I don't think it's to bad, I'm no expert yet
Joshua 08/02/2015
Flow control is pretty much the same in any language
Joshua 08/02/2015
Personal opinion
Joshua 08/02/2015
Then it's just a matter of learning the gotchas
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah
Andrew   08/02/2015
ugh...I'm having issues with this chat client....the text box is messing up the submit
Andrew   08/02/2015
I'm checking out your portfolio page rite now, Matt..
Andrew   08/02/2015
Besides the CSS style issues yall run into any gnarly issues with your projects?
Matthew 08/02/2015
not really just nitpicky stuff the reviewer didn't like
Andrew   08/02/2015
nice work with the portfolio, Matt! its awesome ya already got legit projects you are linking right off there
Matthew 08/02/2015
like where i copied some google font <link> and they used single quotes and another place the thing i copy pasted used double spaces instead of tabs
thanks!
Andrew   08/02/2015
I noticed an issue with the images in mobile mode
Matthew 08/02/2015
whats that?
Andrew   08/02/2015
check out the cat pic in a small window..
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah i just noticed that earlier
Matthew 08/02/2015
I think i need to work with srcset to let the browser size pick the image?
maybe?
Andrew   08/02/2015
I feel like thats a good more badass option to handle it...configuring for a server to deliver an optimized image
Andrew   08/02/2015
Tell ya what tho, even with those image files you can instruct the browser to scale em down
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah im going to try and do that
Andrew   08/02/2015
Josh have ya run into issues displaying images the way you want?
Andrew   08/02/2015
this is me riffing off the top of my head, but I think Bootstrap has some classes that deal with responsive images
Andrew   08/02/2015
OK, this is me being subjective (and I am def no layout Gawd) but I like more space btwn my sections
Andrew   08/02/2015
Especially in mobile mode, where the content goes into column, some space or dividers are helpful
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah
Andrew   08/02/2015
I'm also thinking I'd like contact info visible on top, but I'd love to hear opinions on that...I actually gotta totally revamp my own portfolio page
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah, id agree with that too. I was following along the design mockup
Matthew 08/02/2015
then decided to add that. if they dont dock me for that imma change it around
Andrew   08/02/2015
I hear ya...what I like bout P1 and P2 is that its like stuff we needed to build anyway :p
Matthew 08/02/2015
yep
Andrew   08/02/2015
so the graders are pretty strict about style eh?
Andrew   08/02/2015
they are prolly stricter than when I did my project...I remember using the Google style guide at that time tho
Matthew 08/02/2015
they havent been yet, I wasn't exact on with my first submission and they didnt mind it. they were more concerned with using css shorthand and stuff like that
Andrew   08/02/2015
wonder if Udacity has their own style guide now?
Andrew   08/02/2015
oh man, if setting like one margin direction is a no-no then my stylesheets are in trouble
Matthew 08/02/2015
thats what im saying! ugh
lol
run that up the chain andrew. its ridiculous
Andrew   08/02/2015
I tell ya what...I suspect it may very well come down to who the reviewer is...
Andrew   08/02/2015
Cuz there is a pantheon of graders and it definitely feels like one person's style rule of thumb may very well be a nogo for another heh
Andrew   08/02/2015
thats definitely something I figure they should be hashing out (THE Spec)
Matthew 08/02/2015
yeah
Andrew   08/02/2015
lets see if I can an official Udacity style guide real quik
Andrew   08/02/2015
ah ok its under the "Resources" tab
Andrew   08/02/2015
One area where I am actively trying to improve with my stylesheets is in organizing blocks of rules
Andrew   08/02/2015
my projects have mostly been super organic, with the order of rules getting kind of dicey...like sections styles up top but 200 lines later here come some Header styles!
Matthew 08/02/2015
lol
yeah
Matthew 08/02/2015
been there
Andrew   08/02/2015
do you have any preferred method to name and group your css rules?
Matthew 08/02/2015
no im trying to work on that too
Andrew   08/02/2015
I feel like I'm good now cuz only I have to deal with it...but work on a team and UHOH
Andrew   08/02/2015
a buddy of mine recommended I check out this naming convention: http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/
Andrew   08/02/2015
its a super-wordy method but I can see the logic. Like self-enforced name spacing
Andrew   08/02/2015
has anyone played around with their browser web-inspector yet?
Andrew   08/02/2015
heh, its a slow Sunday :P Y'all, just holler if you are here...will be sitting here eating some Cold Noodles

Andrew   08/02/2015
ah, CSS POP QUIZ to anyone: how would you center an element horizontally in it's parent element??
Matthew 08/02/2015
Margin: auto?
Andrew   08/02/2015
That does work! depending on the child element
Andrew   08/02/2015
Hah sry, was just playing around in CodePen
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oXJdQG
Andrew   08/02/2015
Your margin rule worked for me when the child was a DIV
Andrew   08/02/2015
what would it take if the child is an inline element like a SPAN?
Andrew   08/02/2015
OK I just upgraded the challenge a bit...center two SPANs inline in the parent..
Andrew   08/02/2015
grr I haven't figured it my own challenge yet :\
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oXJdQG
Andrew   08/02/2015
OK I succeeded so far only with the wonderful and magical 'FLEX' method
Andrew   08/02/2015
Its still not QUITE 100% browser supported tho... http://caniuse.com/flexbox
Andrew   08/02/2015
*shakes fist at IE 9 and below*
Andrew   08/02/2015
Alright, wow the No-Flexbox solution was a bit hacky. I won't spoil it in case anyone else wants to figure it out hahah
Andrew   08/02/2015
So Wow, it was real quite tonite. Everyone, definitely let me know if there are issues with scheduling or if there any suggestions for how to liven up our study sessions. I want this to be useful and hopefully fun! Maybe some random CSS challenges :)
Andrew   08/02/2015
OK some links before I sign off for the nite:
Andrew   08/02/2015
first time I saw this really blew my mind what is possible with CSS... http://www.csszengarden.com/
Andrew   08/02/2015
This meme pretty accurately describes my reaction over getting 'box-model' for the first time... http://frontenddevreactions.tumblr.com/post/50110341554/the-first-time-i-heard-about-box-sizing
Andrew   08/02/2015
In my case there was probably and overturned desk and doves flying in the background, too


### Session

Andrew   08/05/2015
Hi y'all! So we were talking a bit about somewhat frustrating Style grading last session...I could sympathize since I write CSS rules a bit inconsistently.
Andrew   08/05/2015
I asked colleagues and got a response that made me nod and go 'ah good point':
Andrew   08/05/2015
*You might point out that the point of a style guide is not to say that using individual margin rules is the RIGHT way of doing things (or spaces instead of tabs, or whatever other things), rather it's a way of making sure that people write code consistently which makes it easier to work as a team and to pick up and work on someone else's code.*
Andrew   08/05/2015
I'm learning everyday :)
Udacibot   08/09/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait!
Andrew   08/09/2015
Hi everyone! Hope y'all had a good week..
Andrew   08/09/2015
Finally submitted my P3 for the full-stack ND wooohoo!
Matthew 08/09/2015
Good work!
Matthew 08/09/2015
I'm watching these udacity tutorial vids on git and github
Andrew   08/09/2015
Thank you...I totally fell into the trap of getting too caught up in some minor detail tho :\
3 week -> 6 weeks, smh
Matthew 08/09/2015
Lol
Andrew   08/09/2015
Oh sweet, I have been thinking about jumping into some github discussion last couple wks
Andrew   08/09/2015
how has the week been, btw?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Yeah I've used it a very little amount but figured I should watch these and figure out what I'm doing but they're taking forever
Matthew 08/09/2015
Good. I'm in the process of moving to Denver so been back and forth from there apt hunting :$
Andrew   08/09/2015
Ugh, I wish some good websites to rec but I haven't had to search for a while
Andrew   08/09/2015
maybe Air BnB?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Imma check it thanks :)
Matthew 08/09/2015
I also had to get on udacity for not doing anything when I resubmitted p1 like 10 days ago
Andrew   08/09/2015
I just popped over to admire the air BnB site...as Front-End folks now, does anyone ever go to sites and just kinda view it in different browser windows? See if/how layout changes?
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt, wow, they are usually like 1-2 days
Andrew   08/09/2015
My P3, submitted on Saturday, was reviewed on sunday @_@
Matthew 08/09/2015
Nice I was wondering if they worked weekends
Andrew   08/09/2015
Right? I assume they got back to ya?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Said they'd get my email to the right team
Andrew   08/09/2015
OK I'll make a note of it too, JIC
Andrew   08/09/2015
ah, we are officially in Study Time. Hope we can a get a good turnout tonite, everyone has GOTTA be tired of my yapping :p
Matthew 08/09/2015
Cool thanks
Andrew   08/09/2015
Folks, please say "whats uppppp!" when you check in
Matthew 08/09/2015
Lol
Alicia 08/09/2015
Hey
Andrew   08/09/2015
yay Alicia, how is it going? (I think you are at work around now)
Alicia 08/09/2015
No, no bartending tonight. And I'm good, how are u?
Andrew   08/09/2015
Full stack projects and FINALLY underway with job searching
Andrew   08/09/2015
Y'all, cover letters are killin me hahah
Matthew 08/09/2015
What are you working on in terms of udacity front end program Alicia?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Yeah I've got a basic format
Matthew 08/09/2015
I just need the resume skills and portfolio to back it up ;)
Alicia 08/09/2015
Haha still on p1, life has definitely been happening!
Matthew 08/09/2015
Okay good just wanted a measuring stick ;)
Andrew   08/09/2015
I've been trying to 'customise' for each application...I'm feeling kinda foolish with all the time thats taking @_@
Alicia 08/09/2015
Lol, what are you on Matthew? The GitHub tuts after p1??
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia, I remember you have been exploring bootstrap. Guys what are your opinions now that you've used it?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Yep
Matthew 08/09/2015
But my p1 hasn't been sucessfully completed yet
If only they'd get back to me
Alicia 08/09/2015
I wanted to be so much further along but I have so much going on.. It's so hard
Alicia 08/09/2015
Bootstrap is cool. Just a lot to get used to. Matthew did u use bootstrap for your p1 or did you just set up your own grid in CSS and go from there?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Used bootstrap
Matthew 08/09/2015
I was excited to try it so did lol
Andrew   08/09/2015
cheers Alicia, working while learning front-end is def a feat of dedication
Alicia 08/09/2015
I should do that because I cannot for the life of me get my display to work correctly and I'm not sure why..
Andrew   08/09/2015
Oh, I thought bootstrap was mandatory for P1?
Matthew 08/09/2015
Using the 12-col grid system of boot step worked well for me
Matthew 08/09/2015
I think it says you have the option
Alicia 08/09/2015
I didn't see it was mandatory?!
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt: ah, thx for the confirmation
Andrew   08/09/2015
Bootstrap is definitely a great speeder-upper...for me the problem was when I wanted to do layout outside its parameters -_-
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia, what kind of display issues have you been working through?
Alicia 08/09/2015
Just the display is giving me problems. I used placeholder images so i just need the display to work and I'm basically done
Andrew   08/09/2015
hmm... do you mean like the images resizing correctly when on smaller browser window?
Andrew   08/09/2015
Or are major divs/sections not laying out like you sketched out?
Alicia 08/09/2015
nah..
Alicia 08/09/2015
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbogeO <-- the display:inline-block property is only allowing 2 out of 3 of the elements to display correctly in my featured work section and i don't know why..
Alicia 08/09/2015
and it's not working at all in my header part at the top
Andrew   08/09/2015
oh cool, was about to ask you to throw up a 'pen :p
Andrew   08/09/2015
lets take a look...
Andrew   08/09/2015
btw Matt, if you or anyone else has some ideas, please TAKE THE GLORY (of css diagnosis)
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia: ah, I see...the three sections should have enough room to layout on one line right
Alicia 08/09/2015
yes
Matthew 08/09/2015
Maybe set the image widths in the css to not max-width 100% and height auto?
Set one more definitive
Andrew   08/09/2015
ooo lets try it out
Matthew 08/09/2015
It's hard for me to tell I'm on my phone
Andrew   08/09/2015
hope the internet situation improves for ya soon, Matt :)
Andrew   08/09/2015
so to describe the basic html structure...
Matthew 08/09/2015
Hold on I'm hotspotting my work phone to the MacBook. Since I'm in the process of a move we are at the mother in laws house. Crappy interwebz
Andrew   08/09/2015
a Sectional div with three main child elements, one for each project...
Andrew   08/09/2015
each of those children are given a class to govern their width...they should always be able to share 1/3 each
Andrew   08/09/2015
the grid class they are given should set their width (regardless of image size) to 33.33% ,max right
Alicia 08/09/2015
..right
Andrew   08/09/2015
so something is changing, or like overriding that rule
Andrew   08/09/2015
ok, lets look at Matt's idea and scan the css for anything that might be overriding the grid rules..
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia, have you tried temporarily taking out the max-width rule that Matt suggested?
Alicia 08/09/2015
yes, i just tried it and it still only has 2 elements on 1 line and the 3rd on another
Andrew   08/09/2015
quick aside: wouldnt it be awesome if we just paid one fee for total hi-speed internet coverage? Phone -> home -> laptops = all one reasonable fee. ...OK back to coding..
Matthew 08/09/2015
Margin-border-padding-etc
Alicia 08/09/2015
lol
Andrew   08/09/2015
Hmmm...ok, something struck me. Question:
Andrew   08/09/2015
can someone tell me like a quick blurb about the css box model? Like what it is and how can we control it?
Alicia 08/09/2015
model that controls spacing and area around content. controlled using padding,margins, etc.
Andrew   08/09/2015
ok cool. Honest question, do you think that might be the issue with the portfolio sections, and if not why not?
Matthew 08/09/2015
so changing grid-4 to 30% makes them fit
somethings taking up space
Andrew   08/09/2015
that does work! Or 31 or 32% for that matter also check out. What was the issue?
Matthew 08/09/2015
I actually meant 33% not 33.3 or 33.2 but still I dunno
Alicia 08/09/2015
i can change it, i just was spacing everything by adding 8.33% to each additional grid
Alicia 08/09/2015
33% worked!!
Andrew   08/09/2015
when we deal with element width in % we got to base that off something...
Andrew   08/09/2015
what are we basing it off of?
Matthew 08/09/2015
12 being 100% wide
Andrew   08/09/2015
so child elements, given width in %, gotta look it relative to their parent. The element with grid12 (99.99%) is the parent of the project sections
Matthew 08/09/2015
Er yeah 99.99 in this case
Andrew   08/09/2015
it turns out, even down to .1 of a percent at times(!), we gotta look at how much space is being taken after considering all the space-taking rules
Alicia 08/09/2015
so should i be rounding my numbers off since how i had it divided up before didnt leave me enough space for those 3 elements like i should have?
Andrew   08/09/2015
I had a thought if this was an issue with box-model but it turns out No, right? Because all the elements in the css are given 'border-box' value already
Alicia 08/09/2015
right
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia, rounding off numbers would generally work except to keep one gotcha in mind: even with everything set to border-box we still have to consider margins
Andrew   08/09/2015
in this case, interestingly, I wondered if the width value of all three sections had to be less than the parent container's 99.99%... since they added up to EXACTLY 99.99
Andrew   08/09/2015
so I played with that grid4 value a bit, ie 33.3...33.2...33.1 etc to see if dropping it JUST below the parent limit would be fine
Matthew 08/09/2015
I tried changing grid 12 to 100% and that doesn't help either
Andrew   08/09/2015
very true, and btw great catch with the Grid4 observation Matt!
Andrew   08/09/2015
I am not sure, but there is some *small* value that *just* pushes those inline-block elements out of parent width range
Andrew   08/09/2015
33% works great...but not 33.1% hahah
Matthew 08/09/2015
I'm kinda stumped I set margins and paddings to 0's all over the place
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt, I was thinking the same thing...where are margins even specified right?
Alicia 08/09/2015
No I didn't specify them
Matthew 08/09/2015
I'm not good with border box does that actually add a border
I missed that lesson ;)
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia, this is where, absent someone explaining the seeming inconsistency (since mathematically the three sections should have *just* fit) I'm gonna throw my hands up in the air and be like "its on the browser" :p
Matthew 08/09/2015
Blame ie
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt, I'm not pixel-perfect with my layouts yet either but you DO get used to looking for issues like that when layout breaks
Andrew   08/09/2015
hahah, I often do blame IE. Just btwn us, for all my projects I pretty much NEVER tested in IE >_>
Andrew   08/09/2015
this leads to a great question tho: what browser(s) do y'all use and develop in?
Alicia 08/09/2015
i have a macbook so safari.
Matthew 08/09/2015
Me too but chrome too
Alicia 08/09/2015
i have firefox on my computer but don't use it..
Andrew   08/09/2015
so y'all probably know this but as it turns out...
Andrew   08/09/2015
different browsers do different things to our precious layouts :( In my xp so far, Safari and Chrome are prettttty close, Firefox is not so far and IE...ok I don't know since I irresponsibly havent tested in there yet
Matthew 08/09/2015
Sooo I'm looking at bootstraps css and their col-md-4 is width 33.333333%. I'd do some more investigating but I only have the .min version right here and it's painful to navigate
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt, good call. I am tempted to trace this back THE reason Alicia's example was breaking...something is there, buried deep in cascading CSS @_@
Matthew 08/09/2015
add margin-left: -3px; to featured
call it good
lol
Andrew   08/09/2015
back to the different browsers thing, I keep telling myself I have to get into a good cross-browser testing workflow cuz jobs will probably require it. There are probably some great tools and online testing sites that help tho
Matthew 08/09/2015
something is taking up 3px or 1.5 either side
Andrew   08/09/2015
lol, good stuff. You are chipping away at the mystery. When I was using bootstrap I had this kind of problem too multiple instances...thats when I really started using the inspector
Andrew   08/09/2015
have y'all cracked open your browser's web inspector yet? I think its called 'devTools' in chrome and I *think* Udacity has a course on the tool
Matthew 08/09/2015
yeah they try and plug devtools in all their videos lol
it is pretty nice though
Andrew   08/09/2015
Dude. Its incredddddiblllllle.
Andrew   08/09/2015
Alicia is using Safari but I am pretty sure its just as powerful as the chrome devtools
Andrew   08/09/2015
I really love that I can SEE the elements box model from within the devtool window and see which rules are getting overwritten
Matthew 08/09/2015
yeah that is sweet
Andrew   08/09/2015
ah, you must have just used it to see that it had that mystery 3 pixel separation :)
Matthew 08/09/2015
lol that was just trial and error but woulda made it nice
Andrew   08/09/2015
I hafta say...I crack that sucker open all the time now...even when I visit a random page and I am wondering how they styled something or whatnot lol. It'll happen to you all too!!!
Andrew   08/09/2015
Matt, did you figure out the responsive images bug in your P1 since last wk?
Andrew   08/09/2015
ok, scrolled up and retrieved the link you shared last time: http://mattloveskat.com/portfolio/
Andrew   08/09/2015
In case any other students want a good reference
Matthew 08/09/2015
no I was gonna mention that. Ive thought about maybe a media query for when it gets to the size that it starts block-stacking the images as opposed to inline
but haven't messed with it
Matthew 08/09/2015
its like right when bootstraps media query kicks in and blocks the images it stretches em all wide
but then i still want them to be 100% when its mobile size
ugh
Andrew   08/09/2015
yea, this is the quandary of responsive images. BTW I didn't take the udacity course on responsive web design (it wasn't available back 'in my day')...do you all recommend it?
Matthew 08/09/2015
but how do I capture that screen size that it happens at
Matthew 08/09/2015
i skipped around on it. if you notice now all my img's have srcsets with 3 different image files at 500px w, 1000w, and 1500w and the browser selects the one it wants
Andrew   08/09/2015
lets take a look at the code! I'm gonna open the dev tools over one of your images...
Andrew   08/09/2015
this srcset thing is cool...I didn't even know that existed @_@
Matthew 08/09/2015
im brand new to it. did it last night
Matthew 08/09/2015
i wanted to resubmit it with p1 but udacity wont let me until something happens with the last submittal
Andrew   08/09/2015
note to self: study up on srcsets!
Matthew 08/09/2015
im thinking though that a media query somewhere around a tablet sized screen and kicking my images width's down would help me
Andrew   08/09/2015
ok, so I am looking at the image tag in the inspector...its inside a DIV with a bootstrap grid class kind of like Alicia's Grid4...
Matthew 08/09/2015
im going to try that when i get a chance
Andrew   08/09/2015
now here are the classes applied to the image: img-responsive feat-max modal-hov
Matthew 08/09/2015
img-responsive is a bootstrap one
the other two are from my stylesheet
Matthew 08/09/2015
but dont do a whole lot
Andrew   08/09/2015
OK, so we can see modal-hov doesnt affect layout...its a pointer graphic thing
Matthew 08/09/2015
feat-max {
width: 100%;
height: 180px;
}

.modal-hov {
cursor: pointer;
}
yea
Andrew   08/09/2015
we can PROBABLY assume Bootstrap's class is something we don't really mess with (this is not 100% true tho mwahah)...but lets assume for now
Andrew   08/09/2015
so looking at the feat-max class.... width and height are being manipulated...lets play with those values a bit
Matthew 08/09/2015
img-responsive{display:block;max-width:100%;height:auto}
Andrew   08/09/2015
so, given that css rules cascade (calculated with later rules taking priority) we can see that feat-max overwrites one rule: height
Matthew 08/09/2015
hmm true
Matthew 08/09/2015
very true
Andrew   08/09/2015
this is interesting...I'm just toggling, like disabling and re-enabling rules thru the inspector. We got this situation:
Andrew   08/09/2015
turn off feat-max's height rule and the images regain their proper ratio...but also blow up to uncomfortable size...
Matthew 08/09/2015
yep
Andrew   08/09/2015
if we turn that height rule back ON and toggle off the width: 100% rule the images are limited to a very small size when browser is smaller than 1000px width (im literally pulling on the corners of my browser heh)
Matthew 08/09/2015
yeah I just did that too
Matthew 08/09/2015
im gonna need some version control before i forget all that i just did
lol and i didnt finish watching my git videos... damn
Matthew 08/09/2015
prolly why i should be in devtools and not doing it from my text editor
Andrew   08/09/2015
Git is definitely something I want to discuss next week...I am even kicking around the idea of doing a screencast/chat thing where can screenshare and go thru some git examples
Andrew   08/09/2015
OH MAN, yeah please do it in devtools lol. Changes are only temporary in there
Andrew   08/09/2015
so back to this code...one approach is to take a pointer from Alicia's layout
Andrew   08/09/2015
I like that her custom Grid4 rule (out of 12 total rows) lets her layout assume three columns on smaller screens
Andrew   08/09/2015
so, looking at the bootstrap way it looks like they are kind of nesting grid-column rules that apply depending on browser screen size?
Matthew 08/09/2015
yeah
i thnk
Andrew   08/09/2015
I'd say if you have the time, playing around with those different columns is the way to go. Then I like your idea of setting the feat-max height rule on media-query...maybe below like 500px or whatever looks good...and in that case, a block-centering rule may be needed since the image width will be shorter than the container
Matthew 08/09/2015
yeah im messing with that now
but my gfs gonna kill me
er wife
Andrew   08/09/2015
this is a nice refresher in bootstrap for me
Matthew 08/09/2015
now shes really gonna kill me
Matthew 08/09/2015
so i gotta go, see ya guys later, and gl alicia figuring that out
Andrew   08/09/2015
hahah, my bad. Just tell her I DEMANDED we toy with css layouts :p
Matthew 08/09/2015
lol
yeah thatll go well
Andrew   08/09/2015
cheers Matt, and gluck on the house search
Matthew 08/09/2015
thanks and see yas next time
Andrew   08/09/2015
hmm, what does everyone think about trying a Google-casts setup next time? Used it for a Udacity video chat thing the other day and really liked how easy it was to screen share.
Andrew   08/09/2015
Would anyone be interested in doing some screencast exercises in setting up Github or some tooling around in DevTools?
Andrew   08/09/2015
We could even do some coding exercise in there, then head back in here for discussion. Just kicking around some ideas, would love any comments and suggestions.
Andrew   08/09/2015
OK, link o the nite and then dinner time:
Andrew   08/09/2015
i thought this was simple and sweet: http://responsivelogos.co.uk/

### Session


Udacibot   08/12/2015
#EXCITED that @Matthew submitted a passing project for P1: Build a Portfolio Site! Congratulations 🙌!
Andrew   08/12/2015
@Matthew looks like submission came thru? Good stuff man! If you revise and want some feedback don't hesitate to post here :)
Matthew 08/12/2015
Yep got it through. Still wasn't 100% happy with the image scaling when resizing the browser but it'll do. http://mattloveskat.com/portfolio
Andrew   08/12/2015
I like how it adopts different column layout. For the somewhat weird image auto-scaling, that height value looks to be the culprit.
Andrew   08/12/2015
I was playing in codepen (cuz way more fun than writing cover letters!) and this is a possible solution...it uses the background properties but has the 'downside' of assigning image urls in the css
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/YXMVqQ?editors=110
Andrew   08/12/2015
Also, niiiice looks like the Udacity devs hooked us up with an '@ mention' feature :D
Andrew   08/12/2015
Hope study is going well for everyone! Do. Not. Hesitate. To share and ask questions.
Meme o The Day: http://www.developermemes.com/2015/02/02/youve-broken-the-build-prepare-to-die-developer-meme/
Andrew   08/12/2015
If no one gets the reference I will feel ooooold @_@
Andrew   08/15/2015
Hey hope everyone is having a good weekend. Mega-hot here in Orange County, CA. This hot coffee ain't helpin hah
Andrew   08/15/2015
Lookin forward to your questions, challenges, topics of interest and cool things ya learned. The Google Hangouts idea is still on the table, too if anyone has some feedback on that
Matthew 08/15/2015

Andrew   08/16/2015
Niiice! Congrats, Daniel of Oz! Please feel free to share any of your projects, whether Udacity related or no
Andrew   08/16/2015
Matt: sorry to hear about the laptop issues. most prized (physical) possession has got to be the laptop these days for me. All the work, the links, the backup code files, the library installations...I am not sure if I could configure the Terminal the same way again =\
Andrew   08/16/2015
well, while I chill here (actually its pretty warm) and wait for folks to check in, here is an open question that has been on my mind:
Andrew   08/16/2015
What Text Editor are You Using?
Alicia 08/16/2015
sublime
Andrew   08/16/2015
Yay Hi Alicia!
Alicia 08/16/2015
hi
Andrew   08/16/2015
Sublime does seem to be the default choice for a lot of us.
Andrew   08/16/2015
Have you used any other editors?
Alicia 08/16/2015
no, i've been using sublime from the jump
Andrew   08/16/2015
thats cool, I used Sublime mostly for the last project I did...been jumping around a bit tho
Andrew   08/16/2015
The two that I've been discussing recently are Atom and Brackets. Have any of the other students mentioned those?
Andrew   08/16/2015
http://brackets.io/
https://atom.io/
Andrew   08/16/2015
ah looks like Daniel is with us. Hi Daniel!
Andrew   08/16/2015
guys how has the week gone for you? Have there been any successes to share or challenges to take on?
Andrew   08/16/2015
so I had an epiphany recently. Browsing the forums and saw a question about Responsive Web Design. Has everyone used that CSS calc() function yet?
Andrew   08/16/2015
I didn't even know that existed...using CSS for a year and that useful tool is right under my nose, smh
Andrew   08/16/2015
Here is a short article for the ol' reading list on Calc(), in case like me you have not used it:
http://callmenick.com/post/the-css-calc-function-and-some-uses
Andrew   08/16/2015
(That blog btw has some very cool tutorials on css effects...I plan to do the 'parallax effect' one next)
Andrew   08/16/2015
whoah just noticed they added a 'code' button to the text box =0
Andrew   08/16/2015
...was that emoji box always there...?😵
Andrew   08/16/2015
 calc(10%/2em + 10px*4rem);
thats wild.
Andrew   08/16/2015
folks, just holla if you are here. Let me know what you are working on :)
Alicia 08/16/2015
the week's been cool..just been busy. no i haven't used the css calc function yet and I'm not sure about either the code or emoji buttons, I'm usually on my phone.
Andrew   08/16/2015
ah, so the dev team hasn't rolled out those changes yet...still I give em props for the weekly improvements!
Andrew   08/16/2015
Alicia, we discussing Project 1 layouts last wk....did you successfully submit that ne yet?
Alicia 08/16/2015
no
Andrew   08/16/2015
did Matt's percentages idea help out there or did you bump into another issue? (or just super busy )
Alicia 08/16/2015
nah i used bootstrap
Andrew   08/16/2015
heh cool, gotta love it. I originally thought it was a library just for mock ups but it seems to help a good number of production projects...so I listed it on the ol' resume :p
Andrew   08/16/2015
what are the features you are liking the most in it?
Alicia 08/16/2015
just easier/faster to code in vs setting up your own grid system.
Andrew   08/16/2015
Oh right on. Dang I really got to put some time into the RWD course...I am neglecting grid layouts too much. It does make designing a responsive site way easier than the piece by piece media query bad habit I got into
Andrew   08/16/2015
With Bootstrap I def appreciate the convenient components... I've dropped in modals and nav-tabs in multiple projects
Andrew   08/16/2015
I'm looking at the rubruc for P1 rite now...does anyone plan to hit all the 'Exceeds Expectations' points?
Andrew   08/16/2015
There are some cool extra challenges in there that will get a lot of burn down the line in our field...nav bars, components
Andrew   08/16/2015
Ah and they want 'semantic' html...I think Yui asked about that before.
Andrew   08/16/2015
OH. This reminds me to study 'srcset' (one of the Exceeds points)
Andrew   08/16/2015
one of the students here clued me in on that couple weeks back...seems like I have to host multiple images. Wonder if there is a drawback there
Andrew   08/16/2015
from that calc article I linked above (yup, I'm still goin on about this!) a commenter illustrated a *really* easy way to make quik grid columns in the case you don't have access to a framework/bootstrap:
 .col-1 {
width: calc(100%/12*1);
}

.col-2 {
width: calc(100%/12*2);
}

.col-3 {
width: calc(100%/12*3);
}
 man this code btn is cool
Andrew   08/16/2015
Awrite y'all, gonna call it a session. Afraid I have not been terribly helpful! I want to encourage all of us to interact with each other better...thats the value in a team.
Andrew   08/16/2015
If you have any feedback or ideas for me to help promote that, just gimme an earful: uncleoptimus@gmail.com
Andrew   08/16/2015
also considering how to use that innnnnteresting 'hangouts' feature I see on the sidebar.
Andrew   08/16/2015
Alicia's comment earlier brings up a good pt...many students may be accessing the team chat mostly from phones which would not be conducive to screen shares.
Andrew   08/16/2015
Perhaps folks are interested in setting up some mini pair-programming sessions instead, and keep this time slot for potential chat
Andrew   08/16/2015
OK, have a great nite and a wonderful week!
Alicia 08/16/2015
goodnight you too

A cool little color matching tool...I'm pretty bad with color matching so I've been plugging in some main colors to find complementary ones
Matthew 08/23/2015
I'm awol tonight again. I'm fighting Apple whose trying to charge me $1260 for a cracked retina display. I'll have something rigged up by next week
Andrew   08/23/2015

Andrew   08/23/2015
hope it works out with them, Matt
Matthew 08/23/2015
Yeah I had a 15" which was prolly 2k but meh
Andrew   08/23/2015
ohhh niiice. the laptop I wanna get when I earn my first front-end paycheck :p
Matthew 08/23/2015
Gracias
Andrew   08/23/2015
I've been oddly tempted by cheapo 13+ inch chromebooks tho @_@
Andrew   08/23/2015
just as a light cheap unix dev system
Matthew 08/23/2015
Yea I have an interview tomorrow actually but the place cranks out websites with square space and I dunno. Plus I don't know if an entry level position can beat the salary I can get doing electrician stuff
Matthew 08/23/2015
And I need monies being in a new city and all lol
Matthew 08/23/2015
I'd rather do all the front end stuff not square space or Wordpress
Matthew 08/23/2015
Anyone have experience with those?
Andrew   08/23/2015
I know a few php/wordpress developers, but fwiw they seemed pretty keen on learning JS to fight off obsolesence
Andrew   08/23/2015
that said, WordPress is huge. They will be around for a while...I'm sure you could grok the php needed to work with components but I get ya...why would you want to spend time on that AND make less money
Matthew 08/23/2015
Lol I was messing around with it and I have to inject my own css and js to get it to look how I want
Ugh
Andrew   08/23/2015
I say kill it on the interviews just for the reps man, and ask plenty of questions about how they see demand for that skillset holding up. Maybe they will have plans or other positions that are not directly tied to working the CMS
Matthew 08/23/2015
Yeah that's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna go through with it for the interview with experience at least
Andrew   08/23/2015
I sympathize...our abilities as a byproduct of this ND program I think put us at a separate operational level...we can do pretty much everything in JS, HTML and CSS
Andrew   08/23/2015
Would LOVE to hear your reflections on the experience. I'm gearing up for them myself...my last one went kinda cruddy lol
Matthew 08/23/2015
Yep
Alicia 08/23/2015
Squarespace sucks!! I hate it, every time I try to take on a project with it, I get discouraged. .. But that's just me, lol @matt
Andrew   08/23/2015
Heyhey Alicia!
Alicia 08/23/2015
Hey
Matthew 08/23/2015
Yeah that's my initial reaction with it too
Andrew   08/23/2015
come to think it, I thought Square space was just hosting
Andrew   08/23/2015
didn't realize they were the whole CMS shebang
Alicia 08/23/2015
I've tried it twice and honestly ended up using the stupid interface to create the sites.. As if I don't know how to code. :(
Andrew   08/23/2015
Ya know I hesitate to say this, in case there are wordpress developers on our team, but I always kinda held that view too
Matthew 08/23/2015
Seems to be a big rage right now though
Andrew   08/23/2015
the thing is we all know how big Wordpress and like Drupal is...
Andrew   08/23/2015
...it could be that, as a front-end leaning person I am diametrically opposed to server-side focused page generation. And also what Alicia said about some aversion to resorting to an interface
Andrew   08/23/2015
Definitely anyone call me out there if I am off-base!
Andrew   08/23/2015
ah, I wanna drop this link in before I forget...Hackernews discussion about using Chromebooks for web dev: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8172025
Andrew   08/23/2015
BTW, y'all how is the coding going? If ya hit any challenges this week, what were they?
Andrew   08/23/2015
Ive been wrassling with Materialize (VERY similar to Bootstrap, highly google flavored) and getting frustrated with media queries
Andrew   08/23/2015
OK so I've been peeping squarespace.com ...
I know, boo hissss :p
Andrew   08/23/2015
But what I folks to check out is a really cool effect in the second section...
Andrew   08/23/2015
The "Create a Beeutiful Site" section...as User scrolls and arrives at that section, it locks momentarily (stops scrolling) with only the side copy continuing to scroll...
Andrew   08/23/2015
A parallax type effect, I think its called. Man I dig those.
Andrew   08/23/2015
Question: how does it work!?!?😺
Andrew   08/23/2015
OK, back from a bit of detective work... I loaded the squarespace site with devtools open to see if they use any special JS libraries
Andrew   08/23/2015
Boom: I recognize 'YUI' ... its the Yahoo User Interface set of JS modules. Basically a Yahoo-made JS framework that dates from mid-2000s
Andrew   08/23/2015
We can pretty much equate it to the Angular, Ember etc etc frameworks :)
Matthew 08/23/2015
Lol wow
Andrew   08/23/2015
No wonder its confusing to code directly into Squarespace...you have to learn YUI library calls and structure!
The plot thickens, Matt: http://www.sitepoint.com/death-yui-can-teach-developers/
Andrew   08/23/2015
Thats right, Yahoo has dropped YUI...they are migrating to a hybrid React JS tech stack : http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/101682875656/evolving-yahoo-mail
Andrew   08/23/2015
What this means for a Squarespace developer, I am not sure (and our own Matt who just may be interviewing into such a position)
http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/58459/what-does-yahoo-dropping-yui-mean-for-squarespace
Andrew   08/23/2015
I'll bet ya make those guys sweat a little if you bring this up lol
Andrew   08/23/2015
OK team, I'll call end of session here...but I'd *LOVE* if someone could explain how they do that cool scrolling effect on the squarespace.com site (may have to view on desktop to trigger it)
Andrew   08/23/2015
If someone can enlighten me on that, I will gift you with the most epic squirrel-related video on all of Youtube!! 😆
Andrew   08/23/2015
G-nite to all, best of wishes to your coming week and don't hesitate to drop questions, comments, links anytime!

Andrew   08/30/2015
he did php and html in a college class back in the day but was figuring out if he needed to learn JS for a small front-end type project for his company..

It got me really pumped to be knee deep learning and improving my JavaScript ability...def give it a watch at lunch break or whenever
Andrew   08/30/2015
Ah, looking over the suggested courses I remember now jQuery is on there too...
Andrew   08/30/2015
I wonder what percent of popular sites on the web utilize jQuery?

To the GOOGLES!
Andrew   08/30/2015
whoah...I was expecting high but not THIS high... http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery/all/all
Andrew   08/30/2015
TLDC (Too Lazy Didnt Clik) : "JQuery is used by 95.5% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 65.6% of all websites."

Well I took that job that does squarespace and wordpress. But I can basically do what I want since it's a small media advertising agency.
Matthew 08/30/2015

Andrew   08/30/2015
I am gonna be uber-intrigued to hear what ya think after giving those a fair shake...
Matthew 08/30/2015
Yeah they liked that I can do actual code stuff. I guess their old person had a tough time getting an element to move from one side to the other and stuff. I should be able to manipulate the code at the very least
Matthew 08/30/2015
Sweet talked em a bit too so we'll see ;)
Andrew   08/30/2015

Andrew   08/30/2015
Did they take a look at your personal projects? I bet your engagement site was a good Proof of Concept for em
Matthew 08/30/2015
Yeah they looked at my personal stuff and my udacity portfolio and it was enough lol
Andrew   08/30/2015
" I guess their old person had a tough time getting an element to move from one side to the other " ... oh man hehe

you'll be doubling your hrly rate there in no time when they see all the stuff you can make move :)

Lol hopefully
Andrew   08/30/2015
then you'll show images on the page *morphing* to fit window size...triple dat hrly rate!

Andrew   09/06/2015
Yui, would you be able to give those top-bottom elements a width of 100%?
Andrew   09/06/2015
@Yui, or do you mean change the order of the elements in a flex container?
Andrew   09/06/2015
I'm thinking of this from the css-tricks guide: "By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container."

Andrew   09/13/2015
'zup Matt. Macbook all good?
Andrew   09/13/2015
!💥
Andrew   09/13/2015
and how is the new dev position going???
Matthew 09/13/2015
It's going pretty well. Lol. And my MacBook is still unfixed because I can't afford to fix the screen. So I'm trying to do this js resume project so I don't get kicked outta this group!
Matthew 09/13/2015
I brought my work laptop to do it on
Andrew   09/13/2015
aw man on that macbook :\
Andrew   09/13/2015
what kind of machine does work have ya on?
hope its not a 2004 dell inspiron
Andrew   09/13/2015
"uninspiron" teehee
Matthew 09/13/2015
A pretty sweet asus laptop that's gigantic lol but I'm used to macs os and all my udacity stuff was on there too. I dunno if I'm gonna make it by the deadline which is tomorrow, which sucks
Andrew   09/13/2015
oh dude you can do it...where ya in the project now?
Andrew   09/13/2015
by and large, we can break Project 2 down into several main steps:
Andrew   09/13/2015
- define your resume section objects (2 parts: data object and render function)
Matthew 09/13/2015
I'm watching videos still lol so long way to go
Andrew   09/13/2015
- call all section render functions to spit html to the page (yay jQuery)
Alicia 09/13/2015
I might get kicked out too, I'm still watching vids
Andrew   09/13/2015
Hiya Alicia!
Alicia 09/13/2015
Hey Andrew
Andrew   09/13/2015
well lets josh on this project 2 in the absence of other questions...
Andrew   09/13/2015
like taking my cliff-notes version of that JS course :)
Matthew 09/13/2015
See and I've kinda thought myself a bunch of jquery the past two weeks to manipulate things on squarespace lol
Andrew   09/13/2015
good, good. Alicia are you comfortable with jQuery?
Alicia 09/13/2015
Nah I'm not
Andrew   09/13/2015
maybe I can load up a code pen with some sample code and demonstrate the looping/rendering...
Andrew   09/13/2015
ah, I promise to get decent with jQuery (enough for this project) in short order
Matthew 09/13/2015
I'm on the video of string.replace(old,new) now
Andrew   09/13/2015
good, good...real quik Matt, do you have a way to describe jQuery in a nutshell? (while I get some example code together)
Alicia 09/13/2015
Lol that's where I'm at too.. Too far away, so I really might not make it
Andrew   09/13/2015
guys, can I get a link to the project starter page?
Andrew   09/13/2015
the one with the github repo link and whatnot
Matthew 09/13/2015
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd001/l-2962818615/m-2963468585
Andrew   09/13/2015
maybe we can summon @Steve here to help us out too...hes got a nice P2 goin..
thx Matt
Matthew 09/13/2015
I don't know enough about jQuery to describe it just that its a library of the coolest javascript stuff with its own functions and what not
Matthew 09/13/2015
what happes if we don't make the deadline?
:~
Andrew   09/13/2015
Y'all will make it :)
Andrew   09/13/2015
lets grok jQuery in like 3 sentences/examples...then figure out our render functions...last will be the map
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK Good News, now that I see your starter stuff:
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume/blob/master/index.html
Andrew   09/13/2015
index.html seems good to go outside of a google maps api script tag (it is currently commented out)
Matthew 09/13/2015
yea im worried about the map
when i get to it
Andrew   09/13/2015
your local copy of jQuery is already in the project repo...good to go!
Andrew   09/13/2015
lets cross that map bridge when we get to it (its not too bad!)
Matthew 09/13/2015
what is .prepend as opposed to .append
Andrew   09/13/2015
So, jQuery code in a nutshell: The almighty $ (thats 'dolla' sign)
Andrew   09/13/2015
jQuery functions go like this:
Andrew   09/13/2015
$("some kind of css looking query") <= this is the query/searching part
Andrew   09/13/2015
examples:
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $(".someClass")   // this finds all the elements that have this class specified, result is a list you can use for loops to go through
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#someID")  // this finds the ONE element in a document with that ID assigned
Andrew   09/13/2015
So it is all about very conveniently finding stuff in the DOM using those CSS-like indicators
Andrew   09/13/2015
Once you have searched something out, you can then call some jQuery convenience functions on them to do stuff....ex
Matthew 09/13/2015
do we need to customize this resume or basically just replace the %data% and its all good
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#target Element").some$Func();
Andrew   09/13/2015
Matt: basically replace %data% using string.replace...with your own data being put in
Andrew   09/13/2015
For this project, the main jQuery function you need is probably *append*...ex
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#someListContainer").append("<li>stuff!</li>"); // append can take literal strings of html
Andrew   09/13/2015
you can also save the html string to a var and pass it to *append*, like so:
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var htmlString = "<li>stuffity stuff</li>";
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#someListContainer").append(htmlString); // oh yea its that straightforward
Matthew 09/13/2015
aah yea
Matthew 09/13/2015
so we will be appending <li>'s and stuff and not just text text
Andrew   09/13/2015
So, using the jQuery search, how would we first find the *projects* div element? Code snippet below:
 <div id="projects">
      <h2>Projects</h2>
   </div>
Matthew 09/13/2015
$("#projects")
Andrew   09/13/2015
Matt, yes you are getting the crux of what the *render* function will do...
Andrew   09/13/2015
Cool, so now we have like a reference to that *projects* DOM element...lets append something inside it:
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#projects").append("<span>awwwwwww yeahhhhhh</span>");
and that will result in:
Andrew   09/13/2015
 <div id="projects">
      <h2>Projects</h2><span>awwwwww yeahhhhhhh</span>
   </div>
beautiful, right? :)
Matthew 09/13/2015
and prepend would put it in front of the h2 tag eh
Andrew   09/13/2015
So now imagine you have a list of data, like a list of projects to append to the project section. How could we do that??
Andrew   09/13/2015
hint: for loop
Andrew   09/13/2015
btw I'm throwing together a quick jsfiddle that will illustrate this a bit..
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK http://jsfiddle.net/7vkqamjL/1/
Andrew   09/13/2015
Just to show a living demo of using jQuery to easily add stuff to the DOM
Matthew 09/13/2015
love ta fiddle
Andrew   09/13/2015
yeah, that and codepen are the ones I use most often...there are probably a bunch of other similar in-browser IDE
Matthew 09/13/2015
its nice to be able to see all of it at once and run it
gracias
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK, so now we can use jQuery to get our target element. AND we can append stuff INTO that target element...
Andrew   09/13/2015
like Emeril Lagasse (sp?) always sez: lets take it up a notch
Andrew   09/13/2015
Lets have a premade string that we just FEED to the *append* function... after we *string replace* some stuff first, of course!
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK http://jsfiddle.net/7vkqamjL/2/
Andrew   09/13/2015
So string replace is pretty straightforward! Just call the replace method on the string directly, pass it the target string to replace as the 1st arg and the new string content as the 2nd arg.
Andrew   09/13/2015
Now, you can take a pre-made string, replace some part of it with your custom data, then place it right in the DOM with the help of jQuery...oh look
Andrew   09/13/2015
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume/blob/master/js/helper.js
those Udacity nice peoples gave us a whole file full of handy-dandy HTML strings :)
Andrew   09/13/2015
...y'all still with me?
Matthew 09/13/2015
i am, just multitasking. but thats a good page with all those variables
Andrew   09/13/2015
Yup, those give you most of what you need, and you can define your own HTML snippets if you decide to
Andrew   09/13/2015
Taking these HTML strings, formatting em with your own data, then appending them to the appropriate DOM section (ie. 'projects', 'education', 'experience') is EXACTLY what your section render functions will do...they will be pretty dang similar, just dealing with different data
Andrew   09/13/2015
Now speaking of render functions, lets quickly discuss the structure of your project's section objects...
Andrew   09/13/2015
So we know JS objects can have their *properties* be pretty much any type. That includes a string, an integer or a boolean. BUT..
Andrew   09/13/2015
...and object property can also be an array. OR it could be another object. Perhaps most cool, an object property can even be a function. Yup, a friggin function :)
ex.
Matthew 09/13/2015
how do you make an object property an array
like obj = {
eh nvm but yeah
Matthew 09/13/2015
so like obj = {"array" : varArray}; ?
and have the array in a diff var?
Andrew   09/13/2015
Matt: You could totally do that. For this project you will PROBABLY just be defining an array of 'data' right in your Section object tho...
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var critter = {
    name: "Psyduk",
    age: 56,
    married: TRUE,
    kids: [{..another critter..},{...},{...}],
    talk: function () {
        console.alert("SIGHHHHH");
    }
}
Matthew 09/13/2015
aaah
nice
Andrew   09/13/2015
man I went overboard with that example...
Matthew 09/13/2015
lol
Andrew   09/13/2015
So that just shows object properties can be like *anything*. Lets just hash out a quik template of a possible Section object shall we?
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var project_section = {
    data: [{..project details..},{...},{...}],
    render: function () {
        // what happens here??
    }
}
Andrew   09/13/2015
Matt, like you hinted at, the *data* part can actually be external, like a separate file. Heck maybe even on another computer :O ... but for P2 I think the project rubric wants you to define it as part of the Section objects...
So how many Section Objects will you need?
Matthew 09/13/2015
noo clue
Andrew   09/13/2015
I am seeing at least 4.... https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume
Andrew   09/13/2015
ContactInfo/header, work experience, projects, education...
Andrew   09/13/2015
ahhh, and LOCATIONS (the map!) for a total of 5 (?)
Matthew 09/13/2015
doesnt sound bad like that
sorta
Andrew   09/13/2015
Its not too bad :)
Matthew 09/13/2015
if my damn laptop screen wouldnt of broken i wouldnt of waited until the last moment
...so i say
Andrew   09/13/2015
So you guys know basically how to define those render functions (string replace stuff, use jQuery to find element and append inside). But how will you define the Data inside the Section objects?
Andrew   09/13/2015
This part is a potential Gotcha...not because of difficulty, but because the formatting is impt to get right. A LOT of students hit snags that boil down to "oops, data formatting a tiny bit off!"
Matthew 09/13/2015
yeah
Matthew 09/13/2015
that will be the trick eh
Andrew   09/13/2015
its honestly like 98% straightforward...problem is its SO straightforward its easy to get a bit sloppy :p
Matthew 09/13/2015
I can see how thats possible
Andrew   09/13/2015
so lets check out a sample spec from the project page:
Andrew   09/13/2015
projects: array of objects with
title: string
dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
description: string
images: array with string urls
display: function taking no parameters
Andrew   09/13/2015
ugh, the formatting is off there....so its an Section object of TWO main properties: 'projects' and 'display'. (display is the render function)
Andrew   09/13/2015
lets zoom in on this 'projects' array property...
Andrew   09/13/2015
So we will have an array of objects, each representing one of your sample projects, and each containing 4 of their OWN properties: 'title', 'dates', 'description' and 'images'
so what might that look like....
Andrew   09/13/2015
 data = [
    {
        title: "Project 1",
        description: "Such a great project!",
        dates: "Feb 2015 - Mar 2015",
        images: [
            "images/image1.png",
            "images/image2.png",
        ]
    },
    { ... another project similar to the above ... },
    { ... ANOTHER project ...}
],
Andrew   09/13/2015
ohhhhhhhh wait. The data needs to be in JSON format. Everyone good with JSON? Its a BIT different from what I just posted :p
Matthew 09/13/2015
i have no clue wtf JSON even is
Matthew 09/13/2015
java script object notation?
Andrew   09/13/2015
YES! JSON is actually super-convenient and really great.
Andrew   09/13/2015
Its pretty much strictly formatted JS that is really great to use to transfer data with...the main thing is that its got some syntax rules that MUST be followed
Andrew   09/13/2015
You can use this site to validate the JSON you type out, just to be sure its free of small errors: http://jsonlint.com/
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK, the above example data is faulty...its JS but not JSON. Lets revisit that....
Matthew 09/13/2015
Oh I just hit a course video on JSON
seems like a good thing to know
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK, this validates on jsonlint.com
 {
    "data": [
        {
            "title": "Project 1",
            "description": "Such a great project!",
            "dates": "Feb 2015 - Mar 2015",
            "images": [
                "images/image1.png",
                "images/image2.png"
            ]
        },
        {
            "title": "Project TWO",
            "description": "Even greater project!!1",
            "dates": "Mar 2015 - May 2015",
            "images": [
                "images/p2image1.png",
                "images/p2image2.png"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Andrew   09/13/2015
Y'all notice some key differences?
Andrew   09/13/2015
Every property name MUST be in double-quotes
Andrew   09/13/2015
Also be VERY careful of not having some extra trailing commas or whatnot..
Matthew 09/13/2015
jeeze
strict stuff
Andrew   09/13/2015
Yeah...it has to be because its really a data transport format. You guys will see more of this in Project 5 :)
Andrew   09/13/2015
That it looks pretty much like JS and plays super-nice with JS is a great bonus.
Andrew   09/13/2015
Now lets consider how we access the info we define...
Andrew   09/13/2015
The github projet repo has some good examples. Lets check out a couple...
Andrew   09/13/2015
lets say we have an array of data named "my_projects" and it looks like the example above. Lets get the title of Project 1...
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var titleString = my_projects[0].title;
Andrew   09/13/2015
How about if we want to get that string and REPLACE it into an HTML string?
Andrew   09/13/2015
 First lets grab a HTML string from our helpers.js file...
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var HTMLprojectTitle = "<h4>Now Showing:</h4><a class='projectTitle' href='#' target='_blank'>%data%</a>";
Andrew   09/13/2015
Look pretty familiar right? OK lets access our JSON data object and call String replace...
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var formatted_string = HTMLprojectTitle.replace("%data%", titleString);
Andrew   09/13/2015
Cool, cool. Now lets use jQuery supa-powa to put that in the DOM...
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $("#projects").append(formatted_string);
Aw yeah!
Andrew   09/13/2015
BTW guys, code might have small syntax errors....its basically pseudo code
Andrew   09/13/2015
Now, in that data example above, how would we access the SECOND image string in the 'images' array?
Andrew   09/13/2015
 var image_url = data[0].images[1]; // first project in the array, second image in the 'images' array property
Andrew   09/13/2015
Now what about the case where you have multiple object info to append in one section?
Andrew   09/13/2015
Lets use some loopin powers:
Andrew   09/13/2015
Again, using that 'data' example posted above,
Andrew   09/13/2015
 for (var i=0; i<data.length; i++) {
   titleString = data[i].title;   
   HTMLTitle = "<h4>Now Showing:</h4><p class='projectTitle'>%data%</p>";
   $("#projects").append(
       HTMLTitle.replace("%data%", titleString);
   );
}
Andrew   09/13/2015
a little shortcut there, feeding the jQuery *append* function the direct result of the string replacement...
Andrew   09/13/2015
Putting all these pieces we discussed together, we do the string replacement actions shown above for each piece of info in that section. Probably in a loop if there are multiple pieces of data (schools, projects, workplaces, etc)...
Andrew   09/13/2015
Then we wrap that in a function called 'display' and make that function a property of the Section object, as outlined earlier...
Matthew 09/13/2015
holy examples
Matthew 09/13/2015
very nice
Andrew   09/13/2015
Then, when we initialize our little resume app here, we just need to call each section's 'display' function. The order wont matter, because each Section only deals with its own data!
Andrew   09/13/2015
To do this initialize step we can use a very very popular jQuery helper function...
Andrew   09/13/2015
https://api.jquery.com/ready/
Andrew   09/13/2015
You guys will see this helper function ALL. THE. TIME. in the wild. It sez: "On document load, execute the following JS..."
So lets use that function and...
Matthew 09/13/2015
oh yeah ive used that
Andrew   09/13/2015
 $(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called. yay jQuery
  project_section.display(); //boom
  education_section.display(); // baboom
  work_section.display(); // boomboomboom
  // etc
});
Andrew   09/13/2015
o crap I made it all commented somehow lol
Andrew   09/13/2015
I call this part the "Kickoff party" buz it happens when your app loads up, firing off all the functions you defined one after the other
Andrew   09/13/2015
Soooooooo.....it seems like a lot. But remember it is PROCESS.
Andrew   09/13/2015
Define a section's data in JSON and validate it with jsonlint.com
Andrew   09/13/2015
Check out helper.js HTML strings and define your 'display' function in each section, using string replace and jQuery append...
Andrew   09/13/2015
Kick off all your display functions on document load, perhaps with the jQuery helper function above...
Andrew   09/13/2015
And viola. You are a badass :)
Matthew 09/13/2015
yikes
lol
Andrew   09/13/2015
Don't feel overwhelmed! Its step-by-step, HTML string by HTML string.....a Process.
Matthew 09/13/2015
overwhelmage
Andrew   09/13/2015
Just build out one section...and the rest will make sense!
Andrew   09/13/2015
OK, getting kicked out of coffee shop. Will post some thoughts on Map section later. But dont worry about it til you get your sections working....and that really only takes getting ONE of them working to understand the rest clearly.
Matthew 09/13/2015
right on thanks man
appreciate it
Andrew   09/13/2015
BTW for yall working on this P2, ya can hit me up with some specific questions at my email. Maybe we can jump on a quick Hangout since its CrunchTime hah

###Session (sub-session)

Andrew   09/14/2015
Hey all, lets chat about Google maps real quik. Here is the doc that explains the basics :
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
Andrew   09/14/2015
So first you'll need a script tag to load the Maps api (just uncomment that line in your index.html)
Andrew   09/14/2015
Your index.html also already has the map 'container' DIV element..
Andrew   09/14/2015
Then, this whole map biz is practically a two-step process:
Andrew   09/14/2015
1) DEFINE your personal data according to the project specification...the map will be drawing off the infoz you list in your "bio" data section
Andrew   09/14/2015
Here, I'll reproduce one of the pre-written map functions in your helper.js:
Andrew   09/14/2015
 function locationFinder() {
    var locations = []; // initializes an empty array

    // adds the single location property from bio to the locations array
    locations.push(bio.contacts.location);

    // iterates through school locations and appends each location to
    // the locations array
    for (var school in education.schools) {
      locations.push(education.schools[school].location);
    }

    // iterates through work locations and appends each location to
    // the locations array
    for (var job in work.jobs) {
      locations.push(work.jobs[job].location);
    }

    return locations;
  }
Andrew   09/14/2015
This is actually a great guide to how your data JSON thingys are organized...check it out:
Andrew   09/14/2015
- your "bio" section object has a "contacts" object property that itself has a "location" prop
Andrew   09/14/2015
- your "education" section object has a "schools" array, with each item in the array being an object with school details
Andrew   09/14/2015
- your "work" section object has a "jobs" array, with each array item being an objet with details including a "location"
Andrew   09/14/2015
So, the GREAT news is that once you have Defined your data, the actual map display/render is taken care of....you just need to call "initializeMap"!
Andrew   09/14/2015
Perhaps you can trigger that function call the same place you call the other Section object's "display" functions...
Andrew   09/14/2015
Remember that jQuery document-load helper I mentioned above?
Heres an example of what I mean:
Andrew   09/14/2015
 $(function() {
	/* Kickoff Partaaay!!!!! using jQuery document-ready helper method */
	bio.display();
	work.display();
	education.display();
	projects.display();
	initializeMap(); }
*boom boom boom*.
Andrew   09/14/2015
Good luck and happy coding, fellow devs 😊

Well I didn't get kicked out yet? I'm not sure why. I submitted a project but it didn't pass
Matthew 09/16/2015
I haven't checked the review of it yet but I knew it wasn't perfect
Matthew 09/16/2015
Surprised I wasn't axed
Andrew   09/16/2015
ahhh...well done. By submitting before the deadline you actually maintained your cohort status :O
Andrew   09/16/2015
I had heard that was the case before, but had not been certain
Andrew   09/16/2015
I tell ya what, that you turned in *something* within the like 6 hrs (or whatever you had after work) before deadline is pretty dang great :D
Andrew   09/16/2015
@Yui, you doing OK? Did you come up with some good answers for the Flex-box question you asked?

O dang Udacibot, you know-all see-al
Andrew   09/20/2015
Hi everyone! Oppressively hot Sunday has given way to cool evening here in Southern California
Andrew   09/20/2015
Hope The Learning Quest is going well, excited to talk about...well, anything :)
Andrew   09/20/2015
OK, coffee is deployed: fueling in process....process.....
Andrew   09/20/2015
So, just a random share, but I came across this site and REALLY dig this animation effect...
https://confwall.com/
Andrew   09/20/2015
its in the "Take it for a Spin' section. Those blue pulsing dots are something I'm considering for my lil portfolio re-boot
Andrew   09/20/2015
Anyone ever seen a cool effect on a site and wondered how they did it or how to reproduce it??
Andrew   09/20/2015
to DevTools we go.....
Andrew   09/20/2015
....and now to open a new codepen...
Andrew   09/20/2015
ahah. A div with a class of 'dot' is the obvious target...here I pause a bit. The 'Lets Challenge' way is to try to recreate it without peeking any further in DevTools.
Andrew   09/20/2015
BTW, if anyone wants to chat about ANYTHING, just say 'whats up' ... I'm just fun-hacking a bit here
Andrew   09/20/2015
OK, I cheated and drilled down into the element...its uses the *before* and *after* pseudo classes to create the pulsing border.
Andrew   09/20/2015
Anyone use the before/after psuedo elements? You can pull off some real nifty stuff with them.
Andrew   09/20/2015
Obligatory CSS-tricks post showing cool..tricks: https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/
Andrew   09/20/2015
Here are some more cool examples: http://jsfiddle.net/necolas/RKhDQ/embedded/result/
Andrew   09/20/2015
That first one is understated but I think is pretty sweet...just a speech bubble in all CSS. No background image needed!
Andrew   09/20/2015
OK, one more: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/pseudo-element-before-after/
Andrew   09/20/2015
I especially dig that 'stacked images' effect...bit of that iPhotos look
Andrew   09/20/2015
ok...doh. I was wondering why my 'before' tag wasn't coming up in the Pen...got my syntax wrong:
Andrew   09/20/2015
 .className::before { ... }
Andrew   09/20/2015
TWO colons -_- ...
Andrew   09/20/2015
All righty...looks pretty similar thus far (full disclosure: IT BETTER...I'm pretty much copying the style rules over mwahahah)
Andrew   09/20/2015
OK, now onto some animation. Frankly, I kinda suck at animations. Figuring out the timing and whatnots.
Andrew   09/20/2015
google, google....ah this blog looks promising: http://designmodo.com/css3-animations/
Andrew   09/20/2015
Admittedly it looks rather complex the first time you check out the CSS rule(s)....actually, it still looks complex to me many months later :p
Andrew   09/20/2015
The key for me was knowing that css animation is kinda two-step:
Andrew   09/20/2015
1) NAME the animation and specify its major characteristics like duration and repeat play
Andrew   09/20/2015
2) DEFINE that named animation *keyframes* behaviour, or what the animation looks like at different states during its duration. What is cool here is you can specify different ways, like in percent terms
Andrew   09/20/2015
BEWARE GOTCHA: I have spent HOURS during P1 and P2 wondering why my ultra-clever (not really) animations refused to play....
Andrew   09/20/2015
.... remember to keep browser prefixes in mind! This feature is still new enough that many browsers require their 'experimental' prefixes. Good reminder to have our old pal, CanIUse on speed-dial : http://caniuse.com/css-animation
Andrew   09/20/2015
Yikes. iOS and Safari users still largely require their -webkit- prefix!
Andrew   09/20/2015
GOTCHA ADDENDUM ... pssst, the *keyframes* declarations need prefixes too! (I realized after MOAR frustration-time)
Andrew   09/20/2015
Alright back to this 'dots' thing...
Andrew   09/20/2015
problem: the DevTools inspector is not show the keyframe definition used! So, I got two options...
Andrew   09/20/2015
1) play around with the values...I know I am changing the pseudo-element width/height over time to achieve the effect of a pulsating ring around our dot.....
Andrew   09/20/2015
2) ...Or I can just look up the code under the "Sources" tab in devTools :p
Andrew   09/20/2015
Note: if the code is minified, it will be a *bit* harder to read!
Andrew   09/20/2015
...and viola. http://codepen.io/uncleoptimus/pen/qONROr
Andrew   09/20/2015
Looks like things are goin down in Westeros :)
Andrew   09/20/2015
A quiet night! All, hope coding and life are going well and as always if any questions or topics of discussion come to mind don't hesitate to hit up our team. Maybe we can hash out our own Hangouts event sometime...I've been thinking going over some GitHub flow could be cool after chatting with Steve.
G'nite and G'week!!!
Andrew   09/20/2015
@Matthew, hope the new job is going awesome!


###Session (sub-session)

Kshitiz 09/21/2015
Hey Everyone. Coming after long.. ish sick leave. I have completely fallen behind. I am still on Project 1 (will have to review the lessons again, since it has been quite some time). I have a question regarding Project 1.

Does the final output needs to be exactly as the mockup (same images, text etc)? In one of the groups i saw a gentleman submitted a project with his own customized images. Sure his modals were popping out, giving explanation of his projects, but non eof the images from the mockup were there.
Kshitiz 09/21/2015
So i guess i am asking, can we customize it to any extent?
Kshitiz 09/21/2015
Can any one of you show me your P1? I dont need to see the code, just the finished product
Andrew   09/21/2015
Hey, welcome back K! Hope you are feeling way better.
Andrew   09/21/2015
You can pretty much customise P1 it to your hearts content, just make sure the points they ask for in the project rubric are accounted for. Everything else is gravy!
Andrew   09/21/2015
You can even have the project grader give you specific feedback on some extra stuff you included if you specify it in the Note when submitting
Andrew   09/21/2015
hmmm...I wonder if we have an "everyone" summons...
@all
@everyone
@yall
@loddydawdyerrrrybody
guess not :(
Andrew   09/21/2015
K, I've seen P1 for both @Steve and at @Matthew
Andrew   09/21/2015
If they or any other team members are cool with it, please post a link :)
Kshitiz 09/22/2015
Thanks Andrew. Yeah if someone can share their finished product, that would be great. I am sure i will be moved to different cohort, since deadline for P1 was yesterday :P

I will go ahead and implement it with my own customization
Andrew   09/22/2015
I think deadline for *P2* was last week. But if you are still with us, then it is simply Meant to Be. If you got any questions or feeling brain-blocked on a topic, post em here and there is also my email you are welcome to hit me up at: uncle.optimus@gmail
Steve 09/24/2015
HI Kshitiz, my P1 has changed to something completely different from when I submitted it for evaluation. But the design of mine is pretty much the same as the mock. The images I used were just randomly downloaded from the web
Steve 09/24/2015
I'm trying to explore some cloned git web pages. Some of these have a lot of .css files and frameworks included. Does anyone know a good way to find which .css file a class name we inspect on the DOM would be from aside from opening each file and try ctrl F the class name manually for each file?
Matthew 09/24/2015
My p1 is at mattloveskat.com/portfolio. I'm missing a few placer images tho
Andrew   09/24/2015
Cheers for the sharing! Steve are you using Chrome? When I inspect an element in there it displays which css resource the styles are listed *and* gives me a link. If I click the link, it jets me right over to that line in the css file.
Steve 09/24/2015
Hi andrew
Steve 09/24/2015
so this is just a class name within an element
Steve 09/24/2015
in this case it doesn't display any sort of link in the chrome dev tool
Steve 09/24/2015
I do not see this class name under the style tab drop down where the element css are
Andrew   09/24/2015
hm, dunno. Guess i'd have to Brute force it (or like using terminal grep command or something like that....which would mean I'd have to google "terminal grep" :p )
whats the link tho?
Steve 09/24/2015
it's a file i cloned from a private repo, i can show you a screen shot if there's a way to do it on here?
Andrew   09/24/2015
don't think there is yet unfortunately. Can try Codepen, jsfiddle, cloud9. Class is not showing up in the inspector eh....what is that saying...
Andrew   09/24/2015
I didn't even know that was possible!
Steve 09/24/2015
mm.... so the class name is showing up on the small white bar above the style tab
Steve 09/24/2015
that white bar display the element and all the parent elements
Steve 09/24/2015
as well as the class names, but just displaying it there doesn't help me know where it came from
Steve 09/24/2015
I tried to just do a search of "content" in my mac and couldn't find it either
Steve 09/24/2015
this repo uses Angular and Angular's Chart.js framework, so it could be that I'm not looking in the right place
Andrew   09/24/2015
ah there is a layer of complexity, what is angular doing and how its doing it is beyond me....I am hoping you will master it and then teach me
Andrew   09/24/2015
so it sounds like you are not allowed to run the code and view in browser (you mentioned private repo)
Andrew   09/24/2015
and you couldn't open up the project folder in an editor either (then could use its project-wide search)
Steve 09/24/2015
oh i have access permission to it, so i can clone it, I meant that as I can't just link the repo to you to show it to you
Steve 09/24/2015
project wide search?
Steve 09/24/2015
and I know literately nothing about angular, first time taking looking at it haha ^^
Andrew   09/24/2015
Yeah, you using sublime? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20519040/search-in-all-files-in-a-project-in-sublime-text-3
Andrew   09/24/2015
Brackets has it too, pretty sure Atom does
Andrew   09/24/2015
That is weird...so you can run the angular webapp in browser, but when you try to inspect element its style info does not appear in the inspector.... It makes me wonder if the element is hidden or inactive in the view somehow. I was also going to suggest that maybe the styles are declared right in the html template for that view component...but even then I would think a visible DOM element will display its style info in the inspector
Steve 09/25/2015
Hi Andrew, I used that link you gave to look for the class name in my code, thanks for that btw, will be pretty useful in the future :). It looks like the name I'm looking at isn't a CSS element but an Angular Directives. The class name I was looking at was class="chart-bar", the search only found it in the readme doc saying: "There are 6 types of charts so 6 directives: `chart-line`, `chart-bar`, `chart-radar`, `chart-pie`,
50 `chart-polar-area`, `chart-doughnut`."
Steve 09/25/2015
directive is a new concept to me, but it looks like this is why it wasn't showing up when I inspect the element.
Andrew   09/25/2015
hahah, nuthin like being thrown into the fire! If you pick up a bit of angular know-how now, would love to hear your comments on it vs the Knockout.js library for Project 5
Andrew   09/25/2015
@Kshitiz, if you get the chance, let us know how its goin with the portfolio project!


###Session

Udacibot   09/26/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 24 hours ⏰. Can't wait!
Andrew   09/27/2015
hi-5, Udacibot
Udacibot   09/27/2015
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait!
Andrew   09/27/2015
Good evening/morning/afternoon, all
Matthew 09/27/2015
Hi guis. So for my p2 that I'm still working on (I know, I'm behind), I need to define a variable for a for loop to keep it local and not global. so I have 'for (job in work.jobs)' and need to define job but don't know what to var it too! my work.jobs is 'var work = {
"jobs": [
{
"employer": "Avinova Media Group",
"title": "Web Designer",
"location": "Highlands Ranch, Colorado",
"dates": "2015 - Current",
"description": "Developing and designing websites using Squarespace and Wordpress."
},
}..etc
Andrew   09/27/2015
its another terrifically hot weekend in California. I am trying to not use any AC for as long as I can hold out. And that means sweaty living room
Andrew   09/27/2015
Yo Matt. Havent been called a 'GUI' before heh
Matthew 09/27/2015
graphical user interface?
lol
no
Andrew   09/27/2015
naw you are fine timelines wise...lyfe happens, forward progress yo
Andrew   09/27/2015
aight lets look into this loop
Matthew 09/27/2015
btw can you see the moon there? it dissapeared here but no blood coloring and now its covered by clouds :(
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh lets summon @Kshitiz real quik cuz he will be hitting this project soon...
Matthew 09/27/2015
cool
Andrew   09/27/2015
ok I'm gonna step outside for a min to look at blood moon, brb
Andrew   09/27/2015
cloud cover for now :(
Andrew   09/27/2015
OK so you got your *work* object...and its got an array of "job" objects
Matthew 09/27/2015
so it seems I can set it as anything just so it doesn't go global. I just put var job = "test"; and it worked.
Andrew   09/27/2015
yeah thats right...
Andrew   09/27/2015
also, you can try this syntax which I actually prefer when working with arrays:
Matthew 09/27/2015
my reviewer wanted me to put 'use strict'; in the beginning so it didn't work without defining the variable
Andrew   09/27/2015
 jobs.forEach(function(job_obj) { ....doin work ... })
Andrew   09/27/2015
wow, first time I heard of nitpicking the "use strict"
was that a fail point or a friendly suggestion?
Matthew 09/27/2015
just a suggestion
Andrew   09/27/2015
ok cool
Matthew 09/27/2015
also suggested I use only single quotes the whole time but I don't really feel like going back through it
I guess I could find and replace
but meh
Andrew   09/27/2015
btw seriously, you knockin out like 90% of P2 in a day is pretty outstanding
Matthew 09/27/2015
lol, I was happy they didn't demote me
Andrew   09/27/2015
I should have mentioned in the channel that just submitting probably kept you in the cohort. I hope Alicia is doin well with the next team tho
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah I hope so too, felt bad she didn't make it
she'll be fine though
Andrew   09/27/2015
about those quotes, I actually think about that question every and now then when I'm creating DOM elements and whatnot...
Matthew 09/27/2015
I actually almost passed my p2 I just need to expand on a few things and put contacts in the footer
Andrew   09/27/2015
Who decided it was "better" to use single-quotes in regular JS code?
Andrew   09/27/2015
I'mma whip up a code snippet to back up my griping...
Matthew 09/27/2015
hmm I can't find the reviewer's name
Andrew   09/27/2015
 $("#main").append('<div class="classy">This is some text. The student's project passed. Oh no I blew up the string !!1</div>')
....hmmmm
Andrew   09/27/2015
now that I look at my own ironic example I can see how, if we used double-quotes for strings, we'd be borked on every html element attribute like class or src.....
Matthew 09/27/2015
very true
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh how has the new dev position been goin btw?
Matthew 09/27/2015
pretty good. so I came to a breakthrough last week. I had been totally saying screw squarespace's templetes and moving and interacting with stuff via css and jQuery. But I've decided that I was making my life a lot harder on myself because when I move stuff around too much then I have to write all new media queries and such
so now im doing less manipulating
atleast with margins and paddings and especially absolute positioning
and life is easier
lol
Andrew   09/27/2015
You must be like a jQuery purple-belt now! has there been a lot of that YUI-framework-flavored Javascript?
Matthew 09/27/2015
Yeah but it hasn't caused me too many problems yet
Matthew 09/27/2015
I don't necessarily like doing the templete - crank it out as fast as possible thing
but oh well
Andrew   09/27/2015
got any tips for grokking jQuery so quickly? I think for me it was doing some Code School/Code Academy exercises
Andrew   09/27/2015
But I was just looking at this site: http://jqexercise.droppages.com/
Matthew 09/27/2015
plus all the websites im doing are for super-conservative republican political candidates here in colorado, so I have to call and meet with some kinda important people... that i pretty much disagree with
lol
Andrew   09/27/2015
and thinking to myself...hmm....off top of my head, I'm not sure I can do all the easy ones :p
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh man hahah
Andrew   09/27/2015
well, conservative templates for conservative candidates heh
Matthew 09/27/2015
oh sweet though i might mess with this. I have basically mastered .animate() and thats about it
and appending and changing .css() and stuff
lol
yeah
Andrew   09/27/2015
there is a crazy amount of jQuery power....I had this phase where I was like "its better for performance if I don't use jQUery!!!"
Andrew   09/27/2015
partly because a Use needs to download that file, right?
jQuery.js and whatever plugins
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah, that is a problem with this stuff because this templete crap is already slow to begin with. I just got an email yesterday from a client complaining about speed but there's not much i can do
Andrew   09/27/2015
but then I figure, probably 99.8% of all internet users have dozens of cached jQuery files in their browser so, meh :p
oh wow
Matthew 09/27/2015
well they also wanted a image marquee loop of like 5 gigantic .png pics
on every page
Andrew   09/27/2015
Matt, you are going to eat up Project 4's lesson. Lotta good perf shit in there, pardon my french
Matthew 09/27/2015
if I can make it there lol. now that i got caught up with work I can focus on this a bit more now, which is nice
Matthew 09/27/2015
i dont want to be paying 200$ a month forever!
Andrew   09/27/2015
got a link to that site? I'd be curious if I can diagnose any perf stuff just based on things we learn from that class
Andrew   09/27/2015
yea, I had a feeling you were uber-busy with the new job a few weeks back!
Andrew   09/27/2015
on the $200, small consolation is that they'll refund ya half once you finish
Andrew   09/27/2015
I just finished FSND and filled out the tuition-back form...took like 3 secs
Matthew 09/27/2015
i'll see if I can find a link, they haven't set up a domain yet
but that will be very nice
Andrew   09/27/2015
hah, multiple people on Slack complaining about cloud covering up blood moon
Matthew 09/27/2015
https://nathan-brandt-l4rx.squarespace.com/
Matthew 09/27/2015
don't mind most of the crap, im redoing this whole site with a different template that has a built in gallery sliders
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah, disappointing
so maybe it will be faster then
only the initial page is the worst
Matthew 09/27/2015
pw = Sharkey4CU
I think, cant remembre
Andrew   09/27/2015
omg, chat client peaced out for a while there...note to self: update chrome, maybe that will help
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh yeah those images are ginormous
Andrew   09/27/2015
the image compression and serving up display-specific will be big wins there; if ya get the chance, try out that "srcset" attribute that be-dazzled me a few weeks back
let me dig up that smashing article...
Andrew   09/27/2015
ah here it is: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah, I used srset on p1 but I don't know how to implement it in this templete crap lol. I can get to the html but only if I enable a developer mode that bumps up the clients subscription level and cost per month
Andrew   09/27/2015
ohhhh hahah
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah its a pain
Matthew 09/27/2015
unless I could use jquery to addClass()
I thought about trying it
Andrew   09/27/2015
ah, Squarespace
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh yeah! how about addAttribute
Matthew 09/27/2015
I didn't even know of that one
that would work I think!
Matthew 09/27/2015
good work lol
Andrew   09/27/2015
heh even though I said "jQuery is omnipresent now, lets all use jquery" I actually actively try to go without if possible :p
Andrew   09/27/2015
Just use the Vanilla JS, and the good ol' document.somethingsomething methods
Matthew 09/27/2015
yeah
that would help
Andrew   09/27/2015
http://vanilla-js.com/
Andrew   09/27/2015
@everyone, let me know what you think about the "framework" ;)
Andrew   09/27/2015
lets see if we can whip up a lil jquery exercise...
Andrew   09/27/2015
hoho https://jsbin.com/lutatayatu/edit?html,css,js,output
Andrew   09/27/2015
anyone who wants to try it, use jQuery to add the src attribute to the image (I know you can literally type in "src" there but lets enjoy jquery)
Matthew 09/27/2015
very nice :)
Andrew   09/27/2015
oh lemme enhance it with a button mwahah
Andrew   09/27/2015
awww yeah
Andrew   09/27/2015
on a side note, this JSBin onlin editor seems realtime. Like in Codpen or jsfiddle I'd have to click 'save' then share that new link. For this it seems thee is one link and everyone can realtime alter the code....
Andrew   09/27/2015
BONUS: center that button because my feeble attempts have failed hah
Matthew 09/27/2015
lol fun stuff
Andrew   09/27/2015
whew, was just looking through all the different attributes and methods we have on the Document these days: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document
Andrew   09/27/2015
as y'all use jQuery more and more keep in mind: underneath it all is good ol' naked JS!
Andrew   09/27/2015
open question, just for kicks: what method would you use to find a DIV with the #id of "main"...without JS??
Andrew   09/27/2015
OK last question accompanied with some links...then I'm out Blood-moon hunting :)
Andrew   09/27/2015
Im on a mac, so I have used two methods of optimizing my images (compressing, different size sets etc).
1) manually with imageOptim, a free mac app
Andrew   09/27/2015
2) using build scripts like Grunt or Gulp (definitely a valuable tool in our field)
Andrew   09/27/2015
what methods have you used and, for Windows or Mac users, are there any tools or apps you can recommend?
Andrew   09/27/2015
I just googled and found http://optimizilla.com/ and unleash the https://kraken.io/
Andrew   09/27/2015

#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait!
Andrew   10/04/2015
Good luck out there, Aarti. It will all be OK.
Andrew   10/04/2015
nice got a few mins...time to warm up a burrito!!!
Andrew   10/04/2015
awww yeah, nice warm microwave burrito on this frigid sunday evening (68 degrees! brrrr)
Andrew   10/04/2015
Happy October 4th everyone, hope the week went well!
Andrew   10/04/2015
Glancing at the cohort sched, most students should be wrassling with object-oriented JS around now, and perhaps Project 3
Andrew   10/04/2015
This one was difficult for me, I feel stalled out on it for awhile, to tell the truth. There was a bit of a leap from the course materials to the actual project (a game! wooo!)
Andrew   10/04/2015
so as I am parsing images of Wonder Woman (purely for this JS exercise I'm hackin together!) it reminds me of a minor revelation I had this week while watching the Responsive Images course lessons
Andrew   10/04/2015
We've all used
 image1 {
Andrew   10/04/2015
 image1 {
  max-width: 100%;
}
Andrew   10/04/2015
so what does the 100% refer to?
Andrew   10/04/2015
It sez that this element's display width is restricted to the size of its parent. In this case its allowed the entire width of whatever element its inside of, right?
Andrew   10/04/2015
Now when you resize the viewport, the image will scale down nicely and not bleed out of its parent element.
Andrew   10/04/2015
but wait, there is One More Thing...
Andrew   10/04/2015
I realized just this week that the image with max-width 100% won't scale beyond its native width...
Andrew   10/04/2015
No surprise if you already knew this, but I was like "O Dang"
http://codepen.io/uncleoptimus/pen/bVqxrQ
Andrew   10/04/2015
ughh...codepen is down now :\
Andrew   10/04/2015
They launched a redesign a few days ago, anyone cruise it yet? So used to the old look I'm still kinda shocked. Looks like they powered up the search feature tho. Found me a nice paper gradient effect earlier :)
Andrew   10/04/2015
OK moved it good ol JSBin
https://jsbin.com/muvuwoyape/edit?html,css,js,output
Andrew   10/04/2015
Just for fun. jQuery Powaaaaa!
Andrew   10/04/2015
random fact: a big comic fan told me last friday that Wonder-woman could overpower Superman with her magic rope. *The More You Know*
Andrew   10/04/2015
Awrite yall, hope the silence means mucho-progress is being achieved. It got kinda tricky for me though, starting around here. And having to learn Canvas as well!?
Andrew   10/04/2015
Well it helps that canvas is mega-cool. If any questions or challenges arise, you know what to do: POAST!
Andrew   10/04/2015
Have a terrific and productive week with conducive weather patterns!


###Session (sub-session)

Steve 10/07/2015
Hi Andrew, I am going through the AJAX lesson: Building the Move Planner App. There are two error handling lessons in there. The first one tells you that the .error is within jQuery to be used on the $getJSON function for the NYtimes exercise. I was trying to use the same handling for the $ajax function for the wiki exercise and apparently that doesn't work. According to the lesson, I need to use a settimeout to indicate error for the wiki one. I don't understand why just using .error wouldn't work. Isn't .error part of jQuery and shouldn't matter if the datatype is JSON or JSONP?
Udacibot   10/08/2015
#SAD that @Kshitiz has left the team. We will meet again 😭!
Andrew   10/08/2015
Good luck Kshitiz, with the rest of the program. I regret not being able to help ya along.
Andrew   10/08/2015
@Steve its funny you bring up this lesson from the AJAX course. The first time I took it, I got stuck on the wikipedia JSONP bullshizzle and didn't complete that exercise.
Andrew   10/08/2015
Fast forward to now, and its all good...
Andrew   10/08/2015
https://jsbin.com/zisuyizuyi/edit?html,css,js,output
Andrew   10/08/2015
That was fun. Talk about exorcising your demons!
Andrew   10/08/2015
OK so to explain after watching that video again, the two AJAX methods demonstrated differ in one key area: the target API either supports CORS or it does not.
Andrew   10/08/2015
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
Andrew   10/08/2015
So to be clear to other students, this isn't critical to know until Project 5.
Andrew   10/08/2015
Anyways the first demo, NYTimes API, supports this more convenient spec for exchanging resources. We can make the request and data is sent back in some portable format (likely JSON) that our AJAX function can directly act on. The chain of script execution remains in our control, or more accurately within the scope of our AJAX call.
Andrew   10/08/2015
I think of the jQuery AJAX method as like one big function that wraps some other functions like "success" and "error" and will call one of those depending on request outcomes.
Andrew   10/08/2015
OK the second demo, Wikipedia API, doesn't support CORS but does support JSON-P format.
Andrew   10/08/2015
a JSON-P source basically returns some JS wrapper to us that will self-execute to build out the results data. Then it will call whatever callback function we specified, auto-passing the data it just formed.
Andrew   10/08/2015
So the difference there is that with JSON-P its no longer executing in the context of our AJAX call...
Andrew   10/08/2015
in the case of JSON-P requests, our jQuery AJAX function will finish since the resulting data is delivered outside of its execution context. So, that "error handling" stuff has to be taken care of a different way.
Andrew   10/08/2015
Enter setTimeout...in the wiki example, we are explicitly putting some time limit for results to come back. If it doesn't we flash some error message or otherwise gracefully handle this condition. If it DOES return, in our JSONP callback function, we can just erase that Timer object and then happily work with our results.
Whew!
Andrew   10/08/2015
Its pretty twisty stuff. Just explaining left my typing fingers feeling tongue-tied @-@
Andrew   10/08/2015
If its not clear, just ask away. If anyone else has some questions OR CLARIFICATIONS IF IM OFF ON SOMETHING, please chime in!
Matthew 10/08/2015
There's an Ajax lesson in front end web d?
Andrew   10/09/2015
yeah! check your Path...should be listed under Project 5. Using ajax at all in your work projects?
Udacibot   10/09/2015
#EXCITED that @Matthew submitted a passing project for P2: Online Resume! Congratulations 🙌!
Matthew 10/09/2015
^obv im behind ;)
Matthew 10/09/2015
I don't even know what Ajax is lol
Andrew   10/09/2015
Hi-5, Matt. Ya dominated that one.
Andrew   10/09/2015
Ajax is pretty crucial...its basically the protocol for fetching info from some external service or source. Jquery gives us very convenient helper funcs tho, as jquery likes to do
Andrew   10/09/2015
That'll be central to P5...for P3, its gonna be Object-Oriented and hmtl5 Canvas.
Andrew   10/09/2015
Ya crack into any of those courses yet? Canvas is pretty bloody awesome
Matthew 10/09/2015
No but I'm actually excited to check it out
Andrew   10/09/2015
The object oriented stuff is of course centrally impt goin fwd in our careers. The actual course gets mixed reviews tho! Will be curious yalls take on it :p
Matthew 10/09/2015
Haha oh great now I'll be critiquing
Steve 10/09/2015
@matt just so you know you are not behind, I have not done my 4th project. Nor submitted my p2. I only skipped to Ajax because I was more interested in seeing it
Steve 10/09/2015
@andrew hi thank you for the explanation Andrew I understand your explanation. Will try to look at it with this new perspective
Steve 10/09/2015
I was not able to finish the Wikipedia exercise either.
Steve 10/09/2015
I could not get the links to return back correctly because the API needs me to use openSearch instead of input query
Steve 10/09/2015
Even after knowing the answer from reluctantly looking at the solution I looked at the OpenSearch explanation and I know I would not have arrived at the correct conclusion regardless
Steve 10/09/2015
Which kind of concern me because in the real world in my job I will not be able to have a solution presented to me I am wondering how people deal with API that often times does not sufficiently explained its usage
Steve 10/09/2015
Thoughts from your expertise?
Andrew   10/09/2015
I dunno about 'expertise' , but trial-and-error and forehead-meet-desk? Plenty of that!
Andrew   10/09/2015
So two points here: using ajax looks and will feel really weird when you first start with it. Its got a bunch of configurations and you are like "what does this mean....what does that mean...". Not to mention that dealing with the actual results *will* be a challenge as you grapple with the reality asynchronicity.
Andrew   10/09/2015
Second: every API will work depending on the whims of whatever backend engineer designed it. Quite frankly, sometimes its just a bear getting a handle of *how* a certain service wants you to format your request url. It often has to be VERY EXACT or no cheddat.
Andrew   10/09/2015
*cheddar. I'm thinkin cheese. super hungry today. Anyway.
Andrew   10/09/2015
My point is that you'll get more comfy with ajax requests and async coding as you do it. Project 5 will FORCE you to get a certain degree of comfort :p
Andrew   10/09/2015
As for feeling lost dealing with an API, remember that when I first encountered that exercise I couldn't get it to work either. Some APIs are gonna be a douche to work with. JSONP access doesn't help matters either! Even for the most seasoned developer, if you give them a badly documented API service to deal with you can bet they'll be dropping curses left n right!

#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait!
Andrew   10/11/2015
heyo everyone!
Hope its been a good week!
Andrew   10/11/2015
had a nice local JavaScript-related meetup this weekend, saturday and today
Andrew   10/11/2015
the event was the Meteor Hackathon 2015, and even though there weren't that many participants at the event, there were enough to form teams of 3
Andrew   10/11/2015
OK, I dug up the link with the event description: http://meteor-2015.devpost.com/
Andrew   10/11/2015
and actually that reminds me: I need to actually submit my team's project @-@
Andrew   10/11/2015
Has anyone ever done a hackathon type event?
Andrew   10/11/2015
this was my first...and man I got lucky to be teamed with a professional dude, I learned a *ton* about project organization
Andrew   10/11/2015
whoah, kinda sleepy with all the coding...hope yall come in with plen-ty to chat about! :p
Andrew   10/11/2015
So I'm listening to the Object-Oriented JS lessons in the background...
Andrew   10/11/2015
side note: the instructor is a founder of Hack Reactor, one of those coding bootcamps. I actually get quite a bit of mail from them. I've chatted with Steve about bootcamps like these, and actually half of the folks who showed to saturday's Meetup event were recent grads of General Assembly (yup another bootcamp)
Andrew   10/11/2015
Has anybody else attended one or is considering it? One of the selling-pts is a supposedly easier path to land the First Dev Job
Andrew   10/11/2015
anyways, its nice of this instructor to help out with videos at udacity. Especially since I kinda seem them as competitors in a sense
Andrew   10/11/2015
currently listening to talk about 'Scopes' in JS
Andrew   10/11/2015
OK, so Scopes define where we have access to our variables and data
Andrew   10/11/2015
in JS, this notion of Scope is basically controlled through functions...context (ie the keyword "this" and variable access) is based on the function that is being executed...
Andrew   10/11/2015
and this ties neatly into a super-key concept: Closures
oh, get used to hearing that term!
Andrew   10/11/2015
random thought: as I am reviewing these lessons I see they keep using this notion of "enclosing" colored boxes to illustrate enclosing function scopes
Andrew   10/11/2015
...and it keep making me think of CSS and centering elements :p
Andrew   10/11/2015
*sigh* the lesson is a bit abstract for me, this talk of 'sagas' ...
Andrew   10/11/2015
a big deal with this function scope thing, in plainer language, is that it lets you retain data in a private execution context.
Andrew   10/11/2015
what that means: say you create a function object that inside declares a variable "foo"
Andrew   10/11/2015
...yup, I am also so unimaginative I use "foo" as an example
Andrew   10/11/2015
anwyays, even if back in the global scope you declare some separate "foo" variable, when you execute your function the value of "foo" that it uses will be the one it declared itself, safely tucked away in its enclosing function scope
Andrew   10/11/2015
This is great for sharing code and reusing code!
Andrew   10/11/2015
If we have our values nestled away in a function closure we will always have access to their values when executing the function...it doesn't matter if 10 other functions in your app also use the same variable names within their definition.
Andrew   10/11/2015
This idea is at the core of "not polluting the global scope"... basically doing your best to not declare your values within the global/browser-window context because who knows if you will be overwriting a value some other piece of code declared? Or...if someone else's globally-declared variable overwrites something important that you set!
Andrew   10/11/2015
ahhh....the next lesson is on the keyword "this". Volumes have been written on "this".
Andrew   10/11/2015
if you have not already, you *will* be typing and referring to "this" a whoooole lot going forward. Like, all the time.
Andrew   10/11/2015
http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/
Andrew   10/11/2015
The explanation given in that link stands out to me
Andrew   10/11/2015
Awrite yall, no problemos this Sunday either, eh?
Andrew   10/11/2015
@Daniel, @Joshua, @Clifton, @Yui, fellows I hope the learning is going well! Bumps in the road and all. If there is anything I can do to help, just lemme know.
Andrew   10/11/2015
It could very well be going smoothly, but just in case, I know first hand how quickly momentum can dissipate
Andrew   10/11/2015
Have a rad week everyone!

Andrew   10/18/2015
So Steve is on hiatus due to work, best of luck to him and hope he chooses to finish at a later time
Andrew   10/18/2015
I hope its been a productive week for all! I've been busy on a couple of open-source projects I recently joined
Andrew   10/18/2015
One of those is the lil app from the Meteor hackathon event last week.
BOOM link: http://devpost.com/software/theinterview
Andrew   10/18/2015
it was conceived as a more mobile friendly riff on a FEND colleague's project..
Andrew   10/18/2015
cool, found her github link: https://github.com/cch5ng/angular_front_end_interview
Andrew   10/18/2015
the premise is basically to help fresh grads prepare for their first front-end interviews
Andrew   10/18/2015
fellow devs, if there are any topics of note, questions from the week's study or observations on stuff ya learned...please Sound Off :)
Andrew   10/18/2015
as an aside, I had/am having an interesting forum discussion
here is the link to it: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/a-direction-please/13803/20
Andrew   10/18/2015
the backdrop is students expressing frustration with Project 3, specifically feeling grossly underprepared for even getting started
Andrew   10/18/2015
I find myself agreeing with a lot of it actually.
However the issue that I think needs better communication is that the most important skill the program can teach those of us new to this field...
Andrew   10/18/2015
..is self-sufficiency.
Andrew   10/18/2015
And THAT is achieved by learning how to think like a developer. How to approach problems. How to break problems down and employ the parts you already know while identifying what you need to learn. How to find those answers, how to test and try different approaches.
Andrew   10/18/2015
Its not easy, it can feel painful, it can feel like a slog. I've have all those feelings, myself and still do.
Andrew   10/18/2015
My thinking is that the value of the program is providing a framework to fail in. A structure where, if you get lost, you can always find some way to point you back to the path.
Andrew   10/18/2015
Its expected for us to get frustrated and stumped, to need to ask for help sometimes. My colleagues tell me "Get used to that feeling, it will happen on the job. Get used to being tasked to solve unfamiliar problems and to know to ask for help if you get stuck."
Andrew   10/18/2015
I don't know how well Udacity is communicating that aspect of the program, learning to think like a developer. Project 3 apparently felt unfair to a bunch of students after the relative smooth ride of the first two. I wonder if there is a way to frame this phase of the front-end program to kind of mentally gird students for what will be required.
Andrew   10/18/2015
At the same time there are some changes Udacity can make that can help immediately...like putting more explanatory material perhaps in the instructors notes.
Andrew   10/18/2015
Anyyywayyyys
Andrew   10/18/2015
I'm going to need to brush up on HTML5 Canvas
Andrew   10/18/2015
Has anyone taken the course yet?
Andrew   10/18/2015
Based on the examples taught, does it give you at least a good inkling how you'd draw a sprite object (like Frogger or Mario) to the screen?
Andrew   10/18/2015
BTW theres this cool conference coming up....allll about CSS
http://2015.cssdevconf.com/
Andrew   10/18/2015
I am hoping to be accepted as a volunteer for it (since, TBH, the tickets are way above what I can afford right now!)
Andrew   10/18/2015
Awrite, time to check out for the evening...and check IN to writing test cases. Ohoho, test cases. Something for yall to look forward to in Project 6.
Andrew   10/18/2015
I hope the upcoming week is a great one! As always, don't hesitate to drop questions or comments in here or hey at my email (uncle.optimusATgmail)
Andrew   10/18/2015
If you got any exercises or want to try some live-coding hangouts, make your interest known.

Andrew   Today at 7:42 PM
so, hopefully there will be some good discussion today...I see Daniel has passed P3, if you have any useful insights please share
Andrew   Today at 7:53 PM
I really need to brush up on canvas again...I'm checking my bookmarks for some solid ones I filed away
Andrew   Today at 8:01 PM
bah, I didn't bookmark all them I remembered...had to go check my ol' github repo README
Andrew   Today at 8:04 PM
here is a straightforward simple game tutorial: http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/
Andrew   Today at 8:06 PM
its game engine is different of course from the Udacity project but reading the article was a nice hi-level view of the basic steps a game app needs to take
Andrew   Today at 8:09 PM
It also covers some of the low-level stuff that the starter project code already handles for us.
Andrew   Today at 8:12 PM
For example, loading in images...
 var bgImage = new Image();
bgImage.onload = function () {
	bgReady = true;
};
bgImage.src = "images/background.png";
Andrew   Today at 8:12 PM
1) create a new Image object; 2) assign the image's onload property to be a simple function
Andrew   Today at 8:13 PM
That function basically sets some boolean value that will tell the game "engine" that the image file has been loaded into memory
Andrew   Today at 8:14 PM
3) set the *src* property of the Image object...and that looks pretty familiar, right? Just a url to the image file resource in our project's directory...
Andrew   Today at 8:16 PM
But how is this image object transferred to the screen?
Andrew   Today at 8:18 PM
Once we have our Canvas DOM element and render context setup (basically a reference to that element to 'draw' into) its quite straightforward:
 ctx.drawImage(heroImage, hero.x, hero.y);
Andrew   Today at 8:20 PM
There are some interesting things to notice here...
Andrew   Today at 8:21 PM
a) the tutorial author is expressing this draw call with two separate (but related) objects
Andrew   Today at 8:21 PM
b) the *heroImage* is just an Image object, created in the same way noted above...
Andrew   Today at 8:22 PM
c) *hero* is its own object created to hold specific properties, specifically position info
Andrew   Today at 8:22 PM
d) compare this to the starter code in the Udacity project...
Andrew   Today at 8:26 PM
the way we organize the *player* object is a bit different; because the reference to the image file is so closely related to the *player* object itself, we encapsulate that as part of the larger object. The actual image url reference becomes just another property on our *player*
Andrew   Today at 8:31 PM
If you inspect the tutorial code another interesting choice the author made is to handle Update and Render of game objects all in one function.
Andrew   Today at 8:31 PM
You can see that we are encouraged to give each game object class (ie Player, Enemy) its own separate render and update functions.
Andrew   Today at 8:32 PM
Which was is "better"?
Andrew   Today at 8:36 PM
Honestly, for relatively simple games like these I don't think there is a "best". The updates we are making in these cases are super-complex and we only have two types of game objects (Player/Hero and Enemy)
Andrew   Today at 8:37 PM
For a more complex game however? I am no game developer (unless its a frogger clone) but I feel like separating those definitions makes more sense from a *code development/maintenance* standpoint. Especially if working with a team, then different team members can handle the coding and testing of separate object classes
Andrew   Today at 8:38 PM
If anyone has some counter points to that, I would love to hear em tho!
Andrew   Today at 8:39 PM
Here is a second link to a tutorial that I found extremely useful: http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html
Andrew   Today at 8:39 PM
Love the way its divided into more and more complex sections, with interactive segments each step of the way
Andrew   Today at 8:40 PM
I won't dive too deep into this one tonight but can talk more about it during the week or next session.
Andrew   Today at 8:40 PM
I'll say I based the bit of sprite animation in my project off what i learned in this tutorial however!
Andrew   Today at 8:41 PM
Alright, as always hope the one-man discussion proves useful to someone at some point :)
Andrew   Today at 8:41 PM
Man I am psyched about this CSS DevConf...gotta sleep earlier!
Andrew   Today at 8:42 PM
Fun fact: the conference is held on a WWII era cruise ship that now operates as floating hotel and venue.
Andrew   Today at 8:42 PM
Because its late October, outside the ship they have set up a massive Halloween haunted themepark...with scare mazes that extend into the belly of the old ship itself.
Andrew   Today at 8:43 PM
The real kicker? The ship is famously said to be haunted by actual ghosts.... @-@
Andrew   Today at 8:43 PM
Anyways, everyone have a wonderful and productive week and hope you have a frightfully fun halloween!
Daniel Today at 8:49 PM
Hey Andrew and team, gosh I keep missing the chat window – so instead I read a huge slug of the messages, like now!
Daniel Today at 8:50 PM
Hope you have fun at the CSS DevConf Andrew! Do tell us what it's like!


###Session

Andrew   Today at 12:16 PM
G'afternoon all! Friendly reminder, JIC: Daylite Savings Time today. Fall....backkkkkk
Udacibot   Today at 5:30 PM
#REMINDER: We have a Team Meeting in 1 hour ⏰. Can't wait!
Daniel Today at 7:19 PM
I like that - Research Approach!
Well I think my RA is definitely unfortunately more of the trial and error type at the moment. I've started reading a bit of JavaScript: the definitive guide. Trying to get some basics locked in before trying to figure out newer stuff a la ES6. And I'm gonna need to add some extras to my P3 at some point too!
Andrew   Today at 7:28 PM
woot! checkin in! No coffee....coconut juice 2nite
Andrew   Today at 7:29 PM
@Daniel, I have been slowly digesting ES6 JS over the last few months.
Andrew   Today at 7:30 PM
Honestly, you got the right idea...I don't feel like there is any rush to master the ES6 powers but its super nice that its easy to work with thanks to ES6=>ES5 transpilers
Andrew   Today at 7:31 PM
For anyone else thats like "whats ES6" it is the latest stable version of JavaScript that introduces some nice new features...but ultimately, it compiles down to what we are using now, ES5 JavaScript
Andrew   Today at 7:32 PM
any aspects of JavaScript that you are studying now that you'd like to hash out?
Andrew   Today at 7:34 PM
BTW, would love to see your project. I am rather of your Designer SuperPowers. I got difficulty just choosing three colors that don't equal *blechh*
Andrew   Today at 7:36 PM
@everybody, what is the turn-in date for Project 3. I am wondering if its approaching giri-giri time (Japanese for nervous-time)
Andrew   Today at 7:44 PM
so I just got lost googling "game sprite art generator"
Andrew   Today at 7:44 PM
big old row o tabs open in my chrome now..
Andrew   Today at 7:45 PM
makes me reflect on how much time I spent for P3 just googling for game assets and thinking "mwahahah. Legend of Zelda, eat yo heart out!"
Andrew   Today at 7:46 PM
in the end I just did a fairly boring version of Frogger...with like one extra hero sprite :p
Andrew   Today at 7:52 PM
ok this one is massive...I almost hesitate to post this cuz it might turn into a time sink:
http://opengameart.org
Andrew   Today at 7:53 PM
Bonus points: that site's favicon looks A LOT like a character from one of my fave games back in the day.
Andrew   Today at 7:55 PM
Annnnywayyys. If there are any questions or issues..
..or observations..
Andrew   Today at 7:55 PM
..or like youtube links to hamsters eating tiny burritos, don't hesitate to poast
Andrew   Today at 7:56 PM
I do have a topic in mind otherwise...Moar Game Engines, Part 2.
Andrew   Today at 7:57 PM
Specifically, doing a bit of a teardown of P3's game engine. Reading thru that provided code did *wonders* to get me kickstarted on the project
Andrew   Today at 8:00 PM
ok I'm getting side-tracked for a sec...was searching the Udacity site for a cohort timeline and then...
I get sidetracked by something shiny.
Andrew   Today at 8:02 PM
In this case its the animating card flip on Udacity's Nanodegree page.
Check it out: https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree
Andrew   Today at 8:02 PM
Fun fact: a guy from my cohort who got *hired by Udacity* as a Jr front-end guy made that!
Andrew   Today at 8:03 PM
About that card flip effect itself I must say I am mighty curious to reproduce it...
Andrew   Today at 8:05 PM
But I digress! There is a mission to be mished. Grokking the Game Engine...is GO
Andrew   Today at 8:08 PM
Heres the reference point, the P3 starter repo file *engine.js*:
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/blob/master/js/engine.js
Andrew   Today at 8:10 PM
It's quite well documented. But right off the bat there is some JS I found fascinating:
Andrew   Today at 8:12 PM
 var Engine = (function(global) {
    /* Engine.js code */
})(this);
Andrew   Today at 8:13 PM
The whole of Engine.js is essentially wrapped in a big ol' function...that is then immediately invoked.
Andrew   Today at 8:16 PM
This pattern you will see quite a bit going forward, I guarantee. Its called "IIFE" or "Immediately-Invoked Function Expression" and devs do that to sort of enforce scope. In JS, recall we don't have such a thing as "private variables".
Andrew   Today at 8:17 PM
Instead we have the Almighty Function Scope! That is, an invoked function can act as private container of property values and methods... (bonus question: name the key JS principle in play here!)
Andrew   Today at 8:19 PM
So "Engine" is a globally available object that encapsulates the functionality defined within. Thus anything its doing "under-the-hood" (yay pun) will not clash with other code running in your app. If another part of the code needs Engine for something it can interface thru this one globally available var.
Andrew   Today at 8:21 PM
Notice also how it is passing in "this" as a parameter? That is to ensure that references to "global" inside Engine's code is properly bound to the global scope.
Andrew   Today at 8:22 PM
OK now we have identified the big ol' machine, Engine. Lets take a look at some of its important "parts"
Andrew   Today at 8:23 PM
 function main() {
        var now = Date.now(),
            dt = (now - lastTime) / 1000.0;

        update(dt);
        render();

        lastTime = now;

        /* Use the browser's requestAnimationFrame function to call this
         * function again as soon as the browser is able to draw another frame.
         */
        win.requestAnimationFrame(main);
    }
Andrew   Today at 8:24 PM
So I cut out most of the comments for brevity. I encourage anyone to take another look in the repo tho.
Andrew   Today at 8:29 PM
Main is the game loop. Notice that last line: its basically calling itself as part of the requestAnimationFrame routine. That routine is what allows us to smoothly animate action on the screen...every chance it gets, the browser can be sent data to assemble and "paint" to screen.
Andrew   Today at 8:31 PM
I was curious about the call to Date()...it turns out this is for normalizing animation frames between different systems. And by "different systems" I literally mean that without this "dt" our game would run differently (faster or slower) depending on hardware! After all, there are probably a thousand and 1 different computer hardware loadouts... at least!
Daniel Today at 8:34 PM
Thanks for that Andrew 
Lots to read!
Andrew   Today at 8:35 PM
Finally in this block, notice the calls to engine's own "update" and "render" functions. These are made every animation frame and this is how the game state is updated over time. Lets move into the "update" function itself to see whats goin on...
OMG A HUMAN BEING
Andrew   Today at 8:36 PM
waddup Daniel, must be around lunchtime in Oz :)
Andrew   Today at 8:37 PM
If you have anything to add, ask or correct, please just punch in!
Andrew   Today at 8:39 PM
Awrite so about "Update"
 function update(dt) {
        updateEntities(dt);
        // checkCollisions();
  }
Andrew   Today at 8:39 PM
short and sweet. (Again there are copious comments in the actual repo!)
Andrew   Today at 8:40 PM
Its going to call a couple functions to calculate the latest game state...lets check out "updateEntities"
Andrew   Today at 8:41 PM
 function updateEntities(dt) {
        allEnemies.forEach(function(enemy) {
            enemy.update(dt);
        });
        player.update();
    }
Andrew   Today at 8:41 PM
Oho! There we go....starting to look awfully familiar.
Andrew   Today at 8:42 PM
This function is referencing two globals "allEnemies" and "player". Just by their names its clear what we are referring to: the objects that we ourselves instantiated in our app.js code!
Andrew   Today at 8:43 PM
allEnemies, recall, is an array of Enemy objects...so we will use forEach to systematically update each of those Bugz
Andrew   Today at 8:44 PM
Player will just call its update function (that we defined back in app.js)
Andrew   Today at 8:47 PM
What will the respective "update" calls do? They will be calculating new positions for these onscreen objects. NOTE: "Player" works different from "Enemy"...it responds to User input while Enemy just moves according to time. So "Player" update may be performing other tasks.
Andrew   Today at 8:48 PM
So now we see how Engine is directly calling upon other objects we have created, pulling them into the game loop.
Andrew   Today at 8:48 PM
Lets rewind a bit to look at that "render" call from Engine's "update" function..
Andrew   Today at 8:50 PM
 function render() {
        /* This array holds the relative URL to the image used
         * for that particular row of the game level.
         */
        var rowImages = [
                'images/water-block.png',   // Top row is water
                'images/stone-block.png',   // Row 1 of 3 of stone
       ... // MOAR IMAGES
            ],
            numRows = 6,
            numCols = 5,
            row, col;

        for (row = 0; row < numRows; row++) {
            for (col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
                ctx.drawImage(Resources.get(rowImages[row]), col * 101, row * 83);
            }
        }
        renderEntities();
    }
Andrew   Today at 8:51 PM
Grokking this function was like a real light-bulb moment for me. It illustrates how image files in our projects assets folder get put on screen.
Andrew   Today at 8:52 PM
What it first does is literally make a reference to url of the background image tile. Each row of this array is some type of background terrain.
Andrew   Today at 8:54 PM
The loop that follows then draws to Canvas one of these background tiles for x number of columns... (bonus: if you wanted to layout a BIGGER level, how would you do it?). Boom boom boom. And just like that the game "world" is laid out!
Andrew   Today at 8:55 PM
Then check out that last line...renderEntities. Good guess whats gonna happen there, right? ;)
Andrew   Today at 8:55 PM
 function renderEntities() {
        allEnemies.forEach(function(enemy) {
            enemy.render();
        });
        player.render();
    }
Andrew   Today at 8:56 PM
Looks mighty familiar doesnt it? Its literally calling the "render" functions we defined in our app.js
Andrew   Today at 8:57 PM
And what do our "render" functions look like? Yup, basically this:
Andrew   Today at 8:57 PM
 Enemy.prototype.render = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(Resources.get(this.sprite), this.x, this.y);
};
Andrew   Today at 9:00 PM
JUST LIKE drawing the level. Here we can also see the separation of concerns...Engine is drawing the background level/gameWorld itself. But it defers the drawing of the Player and Enemy to a separate object...it doesn't care what Player or Enemies its drawing. It only cares that it has a "render" (and "update") function and things will WORK
Andrew   Today at 9:02 PM
There are a few more functions after this in Engine.js that handle the game state (starting off the game, restarting etc).
Andrew   Today at 9:02 PM
One last thing in here I wanted to point out is:
Andrew   Today at 9:02 PM
 global.ctx = ctx;
Andrew   Today at 9:04 PM
whats going on there? "global", if you check back to earlier in this discussion, is a literal reference to our global scope. Engine is attaching this property to be available to any other modules of code that are running in our app.
Andrew   Today at 9:04 PM
The property itself is the HTML5 Canvas context, a kinda reference to our Canvas DOM element in index.html
Andrew   Today at 9:05 PM
Looking in your app.js code, you noticed in the "render" functions how they refer to "ctx"?
Andrew   Today at 9:05 PM
Now we know where it was created and why we have access to it. Cool, huh?
Andrew   Today at 9:07 PM
This is the benefit of well-structured code. So much easier to reason how things work together. I remember my first webapp thing using jQuery. It truly was (is) quite a branchy mess.
Andrew   Today at 9:08 PM
I mean it works! ...but I have no motivation to work within that thing again :p
Andrew   Today at 9:10 PM
Alright, @everyone, I hope everything is going well. Do update me with your progress if you get the chance!
Andrew   Today at 9:12 PM
hat-tip to @Daniel, will be moving into Project 4 talk very soon. Maybe next week? Yay, performance optimizationz!!! (its not as boring as it might sound!)
A couple points!
Andrew   Today at 9:13 PM
ONE: the time thing at the left may be acting buggy...it should be fixed to reflect the normal time soon.
Andrew   Today at 9:13 PM
sidenote: not a big fan of this daylite savings time. It got awful dark, awful fast today
Andrew   Today at 9:14 PM
TWO: as I mentioned last week I've got the past team chats posted in a github repo:
Andrew   Today at 9:14 PM
https://github.com/uncleoptimus/Team-Chat-Log/blob/master/team-chat-log.txt
Andrew   Today at 9:14 PM
It is LITERALLY a text file. A really log one, hahah
Andrew   Today at 9:15 PM
I aim to keep it updated after each session just in case there is stuff in there we want to check out or RELIVE...without all the scrolling up!
Andrew   Today at 9:16 PM
Hopefully in the near future, Udacity will offer some slick tools for this kind of information review.
Andrew   Today at 9:18 PM
Have an epic week everyone! If you got topics you want to discuss or other questions, BOOM right here. Or a direct line: uncle.optimusATgmail
